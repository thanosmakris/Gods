    "Concept\n",
    "\n",
    "In this project, I will be analyzing the macrostructure of Homer’s epics, the Iliad and the Odyssey. By employing the distant reading and a basic topic modeling method, we will be able to observe the occurrence of gods in the texts and draw conclusions about these two epics.\n",
    "\n",
    "As we already know, the main deities ancient Greeks believed in were the twelve Olympians. Each one of the gods had a specific “type” or set of attributes so that, when people prayed to them, they required a blessing somehow related to that specific attribute. For example, a fisherman would pray to Poseidon, the sea-god, before fishing.\n",
    "\n",
    "My argument is that knowing each god’s attributes and counting how many times they appear in a text, we can identify the underlying micro-narrations that might occur. If Venus, the goddess of love, appears too many times in a text, we can only assume that the text has a lot of ‘love scenes’ and/or tells the story of two lovers or at least the feeling of intimacy in the text is very strong.\n",
    "\n",
    "Gods’ attributes reminded me of Python elements’ attributes and that is what influenced the idea for the project. The main guide for my research was the basic notion of Object-Oriented Programming, as its concepts reflect the concepts of the real world. An object, (i.e. a god/human/entity etc.), can contain multiple types of data (i.e. his/her identity, features, personality etc.). This approach allows for a multi-layered analysis. \n",
    "\n",
    "Methodology\n",
    "\n",
    "The methodology I used for the project goes as follows:\n",
    "Firstly, I used web scraping to gather my data. Then, I parsed it and cleaned it to prepare it for my calculations. After that, I created a Python class named God and passed inside all the attributes, e.g. ‘name’, ‘attribute’ etc. and created 12 god instances based on that class. Using these objects, I calculated how many times each god occurs in each text.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the second part of the project I visualized the findings in order to provide a clear and visually presentable argument. 3 types of graphs were created: A scatterplot, a bar graph and a pie graph.\n",
    "\n",
    "Transitioning from one epic to another, we notice three things:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.\tGod appearances are reduced to half in the Odyssey. Possibly a shift of superstition in people’s minds(?). Or Homer decided to focus more on the human aspect.\n",
    "2.\tMars shares only 4% of all god appearances in the Odyssey in comparison to an 11% in the Iliad. The former is a more peaceful work than the latter.\n",
    "3.\tNeptune and the elements of nature occupy a larger part in the Odyssey.\n",
    "\n",
    "Impact & Improvements\n",
    "\n",
    "This project can be of use to anyone wanting to quickly go through the classical texts. Of course, the scope here is limited. For future improvements I would consider adding more attributes to the God class, as studying personalities can be very complicated. Collocations could also help further understand things like characters’ intentions or even their networks of relations."

 now seen on earth who might with these compare340  yet even these would listen and conform  to my advice in consultation given  which hear ye also for compliance proves  oft times the safer and the manlier course  thou agamemnon valiant as thou art345  seize not the maid his portion from the greeks  but leave her his nor thou achilles strive  with our imperial chief for never king  had equal

therefore agamemnon calm thy wrath  and it shall be mine office to entreat355  achilles also to a calm whose might  the chief munition is of all our host to whom the sovereign of the greeks replied  the son of atreus thou hast spoken well  old chief and wisely but this wrangler here 360  nought will suffice him but the highest place  he must control us all reign over all  dictate to all but he

idomeneus in front  of his bold cretans stood stout as a boar295  the van he occupied while in the rear  meriones harangued the most remote  them so prepared the king of men beheld  with joyful heart

he drove between  that such through mere necessity might act350 096  first to his charioteers he gave in charge  their duty bade them rein their horses hard  shunning confusion let no warrior vain  and overweening of his strength or skill  start from his rank to dare the fight alone355  or fall behind it weakening whom he leaves [13]and if dismounted from his own he climb  another s chariot let

successful and laid many a city low so counsell d them the venerable chief  long time expert in arms him also saw365  king agamemnon with delight and said old chief ah how i wish that thy firm heart  were but supported by as firm a knee  but time unhinges all oh that some youth  had thine old age and thou wast young again370  to whom the valiant nestor thus replied atrides i could also ardent wish  that i were now robust as when i struck  brave ereuthalion[14] breathless to the ground  but never all their gifts the gods confer375  on man at once if then i had the force  of youth i suffer now the effects of age  yet ancient as i am i will be seen  still mingling with the charioteers still prompt  to give them counsel for to counsel youth380 097  is the old warrior s province let the green  in years my juniors unimpaired by time  push with the lance for they have strength to boast so he whom agamemnon joyful heard  and passing thence the son of peteos found385  menestheus foremost in equestrian fame  among the brave athenians near to him  ulysses held his station and at hand  the cephallenians stood hardy and bold  for rumor none of the approaching fight390  them yet had reach d so recent had the stir  arisen in either host they therefore watch d  till the example of some other band  marching should prompt them to begin the fight  but agamemnon thus the king of men395  them

there405  to eat your savory food and quaff your wine  delicious  till satiety ensue  but here you could be well content to stand  spectators only while ten grecian troops  should wage before you the wide-wasting war410 to whom ulysses with resentful tone  dark-frowning thus replied what words are these  which have escaped thy lips and for what cause  atrides hast thou call d me slow to fight  when we of greece shall in sharp contest clash415  with you steed-tamer trojans mark me then  then thou shalt see if the concerns of war  so nearly touch thee and thou so incline 098  the father of telemachus engaged  among the foremost trojans but thy speech420  was light as is the wind and rashly made when him thus moved he saw the monarch smiled  complacent and in gentler terms replied laërtes  noble son for wiles renown d  short reprimand and exhortation short425  suffice for thee nor did i purpose more  for i have known thee long that thou art one  of kindest nature and so much my

confiding in the aid  of jove and in propitious signs from heaven  led to the city consecrate to mars  our little host inferior far to theirs485  and took seven-gated thebes under whose walls  our

pallas forbids the thought  one falls be sure swift as they are the steeds  that whirl them on shall never rescue both300  but hear my bidding and hold fast the word  should all-wise pallas grant me my desire  to slay them both drive not my coursers hence  but hook the reins and seizing quick the pair  that draw æneas urge them from the powers305  of troy away into the host of greece  for they

of peace and amity replied thou art my own hereditary friend  whose noble grandsire was the guest of mine[16]265  for oeneus on a time full twenty days  regaled bellerophon and pledges fair  of hospitality they interchanged 150  oeneus a belt radiant with purple gave  to brave bellerophon who in return270  gave him a golden goblet coming forth  i left the kind memorial safe at home  a child

there  we will not clash trojans or aids of troy  no few the gods shall furnish to my spear  whom i may slaughter and no want of greeks280  on whom to prove thy prowess thou shalt find  but it were well that an exchange ensued  between us take mine armor give me thine  that all who notice us may understand  our patrimonial[17] amity and love285 so they and each alighting hand in hand  stood lock

thou therefore gathering all our matrons seek  the fane of pallas huntress of the spoil  bearing sweet incense but from the attire330  treasured within thy chamber first select 152  the amplest robe

hallowed fane  of the spoil-huntress deity i the while  seek paris and if paris yet can hear  shall call him forth but oh that earth would yawn  and swallow him whom jove hath made a curse345  to troy to priam and to all his house  methinks to see him plunged into the shades  for ever were a cure for all my woes he ceased the queen her palace entering charged  her maidens they incontinent

which i wish d to soothe410  in secret not displeasure or revenge  i tell thee also that even now my wife  was urgent with me in most soothing terms  that i would forth to battle and myself  aware that victory oft changes sides415  that course prefer wait therefore thou awhile   till i shall dress me for the fight or go  thou first and i will overtake thee soon he ceased to whom brave hector

since the gods would bring these ills to pass  i should at least some worthier mate have chosen430  one not insensible to public shame  but this oh this nor hath nor will acquire  hereafter aught which like discretion shows  or reason and shall find his just reward  but enter take this seat for who as thou435  labors or who hath cause like thee to rue 155  the crime my brother for which heaven hath doom d  both paris and my most detested self  to be the burthens of an endless song to whom the warlike hector huge[26] replied440  me bid not helen to a seat howe er  thou wish my stay for thou must not prevail  the trojans miss me and myself no less  am anxious to return but urge in haste  this loiterer forth yea let him urge himself445  to overtake me ere i quit the town  for i must home in haste that i may see  my loved andromache my infant boy  and my domestics ignorant if e er  i shall behold them more or if my fate450  ordain me now to fall by grecian hands so spake the dauntless hero and withdrew  but reaching soon his own well-built abode  he found not fair andromache she stood  lamenting hector with the nurse who bore455  her infant on a turret s top sublime  he then not finding his chaste spouse within  thus from the portal of her train inquired tell me ye maidens whither went from home  andromache the fair[27] went she to see460  her female kindred of my father s house  or to minerva s temple where convened  the bright-hair d matrons of the city seek  to soothe the awful goddess tell me true to whom his household s governess discreet465  since hector truth is thy demand receive  true answer neither went she forth to see 156  her female kindred of thy father s house  nor to minerva s temple where convened  the bright-haired matrons of the city seek470  to soothe the awful goddess but she went  hence to the tower of troy for she had heard  that the achaians had prevail d and driven  the trojans to the walls she therefore wild  with grief flew thither and the nurse her steps475  attended with thy infant in her arms so spake the prudent governess whose words  when hector heard issuing from his door  he backward trod with hasty steps the streets  of lofty troy and having traversed all480  the spacious city when he now approach d  the scæan gate whence he must seek the field  there hasting home again his noble wife  met him andromache the rich-endow d  fair daughter of eëtion famed in arms485  eëtion who in hypoplacian thebes  umbrageous dwelt cilicia s mighty lord   his daughter valiant hector had espoused  there she encounter d him and with herself  the nurse came also bearing in her arms490  hectorides his infant darling boy  beautiful as a star him hector called  scamandrios but astyanax[28] all else  in ilium named him for that hector s arm  alone was the defence and strength of troy495  the father silent eyed his babe and smiled  andromache meantime before him stood  with streaming cheeks hung on his hand and said thy own great courage will cut short thy days  my noble hector neither pitiest thou500  thy helpless infant or my hapless self  whose widowhood is near for thou wilt fall  ere long assail d by the whole host of greece  then let me to the tomb my best retreat 157  when thou art slain for comfort none or joy505  can i expect thy day of life extinct  but thenceforth sorrow father i have none  no mother when cilicia s city thebes  the populous was by achilles sack d  he slew my father yet his gorgeous arms510  stripp d not through reverence of him but consumed  arm d as it was his body on the pile  and heap d his tomb which the oreades  jove s daughters had with elms inclosed around[29]  my seven brothers glory of our house515  all in one day descended to the shades  for brave achilles[30] while they fed their herds  and snowy flocks together slew them all  my mother queen of the well-wooded realm  of hypoplacian thebes her hither brought520  among his other spoils he loosed again  at an inestimable ransom-price  but by diana pierced she died at home  yet hector oh my husband i in thee  find parents brothers all that i have lost525  come have compassion on us go not hence  but guard this turret lest of me thou make  a widow and an orphan of thy boy  the city walls are easiest of ascent  at yonder fig-tree station there thy powers530  for whether by a prophet warn d or taught  by search and observation in that part  each ajax with idomeneus of crete  the sons of atreus and the valiant son 158  of tydeus have now thrice assail d the town535 to whom the leader of the host of troy these cares andromache which thee engage  all touch me also but i dread to incur  the scorn of male and female tongues in troy  if dastard-like i should decline the fight540  nor feel i such a wish no i have learn d  to be courageous ever in the van  among the flower of ilium to assert  my glorious father s honor and my own  for that the day shall come when sacred troy545  when priam and the people of the old  spear-practised king shall perish well i know  but for no trojan sorrows yet to come  so much i mourn not e en for hecuba  nor yet for priam nor for all the brave550  of my own brothers who shall kiss the dust  as for thyself when some achaian chief  shall have convey d thee weeping hence thy sun  of peace and liberty for ever set  then shalt thou toil in argos at the loom555  for a task-mistress and constrain d shalt draw  from hypereïa s fount[31] or from the fount  messeïs water at her proud command  some grecian then seeing thy tears shall say   this was the wife of hector who excell d560  all troy in fight when ilium was besieged  such he shall speak thee and thy heart the while  shall bleed afresh through want of such a friend  to stand between captivity and thee  but may i rest beneath my hill of earth565  or ere that day arrive i would not live  to hear thy cries and see thee torn away so saying illustrious hector stretch d his arms  forth to his son but with a scream the child  fell back into the bosom of his nurse570  his father s aspect dreading whose bright arms 159  he had attentive mark d and shaggy crest  playing tremendous o er his helmet s height  his father and his gentle mother laugh d[32]  and noble hector lifting from his head575  his dazzling helmet placed it on the ground  then kiss d his boy and dandled him and thus  in earnest prayer the heavenly powers implored hear all ye gods as ye have given to me  so also on my son excelling might580  bestow with chief authority in troy  and be his record this in time to come  when he returns from battle lo how far  the son excels the sire may every foe  fall under him and he come laden home585  with spoils blood-stain d to his dear mother s joy he said and gave his infant to the arms  of his andromache who him received  into her fragrant bosom bitter tears  with sweet smiles mingling he with pity moved590  that sight observed soft touch d her cheek and said mourn not my loved andromache for me  too much no man shall send me to the shades  of tartarus ere mine allotted hour  nor lives he who can overpass the date595  by heaven assign d him be he base or brave[33]  go then and occupy content at home  the woman s province ply the distaff spin  and weave and task thy maidens war belongs  to man to all men and of all who first600  drew vital breath in ilium most to me[34] 160  he ceased and from the ground his helmet raised  hair-crested his andromache at once  obedient to her home repair d but oft  turn d as she went and turning wept afresh605  no sooner at the palace she arrived  of havoc-spreading hector than among  her numerous maidens found within she raised  a general lamentation with one voice  in his own house his whole domestic train610  mourn d hector yet alive for none the hope  conceived of his escape from grecian hands  or to behold their living master more nor paris in his stately mansion long  delay d but arm d resplendent traversed swift615  the city all alacrity and joy  as some stall d horse high-fed his stable-cord  snapt short beats under foot the sounding plain  accustomed in smooth-sliding streams to lave  exulting high he bears his head his mane620  undulates o er his shoulders pleased he eyes  his glossy sides and borne on pliant knees  shoots to the meadow where his fellows graze  so paris son of priam from the heights  of pergamus into the streets of troy625  all dazzling as the sun descended flush d  with martial pride and bounding in his course  at once he came where noble hector stood  now turning after conference with his spouse  when godlike alexander thus began630 my hero brother thou hast surely found  my long delay most irksome more dispatch  had pleased thee more for such was thy command to whom the warlike hector thus replied  no man judicious and in feat of arms635  intelligent would pour contempt on thee  for thou art valiant wert thou not remiss  and wilful negligent and when i hear  the very men who labor in thy cause 161  reviling thee i make thy shame my own640  but let us on all such complaints shall cease  hereafter and thy faults be touch d no more  let jove but once afford us riddance clear  of these achaians and to quaff the cup  of liberty before the living gods645     so saying illustrious hector through the gates  to battle rush d with paris at his side  and both were bent on deeds of high renown  as when the gods vouchsafe propitious gales  to longing mariners who with smooth oars5  threshing the waves have all their strength consumed  so them the longing trojans glad received at once each slew a grecian paris slew  menesthius who in arna dwelt the son  of areithoüs club-bearing chief10  and of philomedusa radiant-eyed  but hector wounded with his glittering spear  eïoneus he pierced his neck beneath  his brazen morion s verge and dead he fell  then glaucus leader of the lycian host15  son of hippolochus in furious fight  iphinoüs son of dexias assail d  mounting his rapid mares and with his lance  his shoulder pierced unhorsed he fell and died such slaughter of the grecians in fierce fight20  minerva noting from the olympian hills  flew down to sacred ilium whose approach  marking from pergamus apollo flew  to meet her ardent on the part of troy  beneath the beech they join d when first the king25  the son of jove apollo thus began 166  daughter of jove supreme why hast thou left  olympus and with such impetuous speed  comest thou to give the danaï success  decisive for i know that pity none30  thou feel st for trojans perish as they may  but if advice of mine can influence thee  to that which shall be best let us compose  this day the furious fight which shall again  hereafter rage till ilium be destroy d35  since such is juno s pleasure and thy own him answer d then pallas cærulean-eyed  celestial archer be it so i came  myself so purposing into the field  from the olympian heights but by what means40  wilt thou induce the warriors to a pause to whom the king the son of jove replied  the courage of equestrian hector bold  let us excite that he may challenge forth  to single conflict terrible some chief45  achaian the achaians brazen-mail d  indignant will supply a champion soon  to combat with the noble chief of troy so spake apollo and his counsel pleased  minerva which when helenus the seer50  priam s own son in his prophetic soul  perceived approaching hector thus he spake jove s peer in wisdom hector priam s son  i am thy brother wilt thou list to me  bid cease the battle bid both armies sit55  call first thyself the mightiest of the greeks  to single conflict i have heard the voice  of the eternal gods and well-assured  foretell thee that thy death not now impends he spake whom hector heard with joy elate60  before his van striding into the space  both hosts between he with his spear transverse[1] 167  press d back the trojans and they sat down sat  the well-greaved grecians also at command  of agamemnon and in shape assumed65  of vultures pallas and apollo perch d  high on the lofty beech sacred to jove  the father ægis-arm d delighted thence  they view d the peopled plain horrent around  with shields and helms and glittering spears erect70  as when fresh-blowing zephyrus the flood  sweeps first the ocean blackens at the blast  such seem d the plain whereon the achaians sat  and trojans whom between thus hector spake ye trojans and achaians brazen-greaved75  attend while i shall speak jove high-enthroned  hath not fulfill d the truce but evil plans  against both hosts till either ye shall take  troy s lofty towers or shall yourselves in flight  fall vanquish d at your billow-cleaving barks80  with you is all the flower of greece[2] let him  whose heart shall move him to encounter sole  illustrious hector from among you all  stand forth and jove be witness to us both  if he with his long-pointed lance of life85  shall me bereave my armor is his prize  which he shall hence into your fleet convey  not so my body that he shall resign  for burial to the men and wives of troy  but if apollo make the glory mine90  and he fall vanquish d him will i despoil  and hence conveying into sacred troy  his arms will in the temple hang them high[3] 168  of the bow-bender god but i will send  his body to the fleet that him the greeks95  may grace with rights funereal on the banks  of wide-spread hellespont ye shall upraise  his tomb and as they cleave with oary barks  the sable deep posterity shall say   it is a warrior s tomb in ancient days100  the hero died him warlike hector slew  so men shall speak hereafter and my fame  who slew him and my praise shall never die he ceased and all sat mute his challenge bold  none dared accept which yet they blush d to shun105  till menelaus at the last arose  groaning profound and thus reproach d the greeks ah boasters henceforth women men no more   eternal shame shame infinite is ours  if none of all the grecians dares contend110  with hector dastards deaf to glory s call   rot where ye sit i will myself take arms  against him for the gods alone dispose  at their own pleasure the events of war he ended and put on his radiant arms115  then menelaus manifest appear d  thy death approaching by the dreadful hands  of hector mightier far in arms than thou  but that the chiefs of the achaians all  upstarting stay d thee and himself the king120  the son of atreus on thy better hand  seizing affectionate thee thus address d thou ravest my royal brother and art seized  with needless frenzy but however chafed  restrain thy wrath nor covet to contend125  with priameian hector whom in fight  all dread a warrior thy superior far  not even achilles in the glorious field  though stronger far than thou this hero meets  undaunted go then and thy seat resume130  in thy own band the achaians shall for him 169  doubtless some fitter champion furnish forth  brave though he be and with the toils of war  insatiable he shall be willing yet  seated on his bent knees to breathe a while135  should he escape the arduous brunt severe so saying the hero by his counsel wise  his brother s purpose alter d he complied  and his glad servants eased him of his arms  then nestor thus the argive host bespake140 great wo ye gods hath on achaia fallen  now may the warlike pelaus hoary chief  who both with eloquence and wisdom rules  the myrmidons our foul disgrace deplore  with him discoursing erst of ancient times145  when all your pedigrees i traced i made  his heart bound in him at the proud report  but now when he shall learn how here we sat  cowering at the foot of hector he shall oft  his hands uplift to the immortal gods150  praying a swift release into the shades  jove pallas phœbus oh that i were young  as when the pylians in fierce fight engaged  the arcadians spear-expert beside the stream  of rapid celadon beneath the walls155  we fought of pheia where the jardan rolls  there

when he defied our best all hung their heads  and trembled none dared meet him till at last  with inborn courage warm d and nought dismayed  though youngest of them all i undertook  that contest and by pallas  aid prevail d180  i slew the man in height and bulk all men  surpassing and much soil he cover d slain  oh for the vigor of those better days  then should not hector want a champion long  whose call to combat ye although the prime185  and pride of all our land seem slow to hear he spake reproachful when at once arose  nine heroes agamemnon king of men  foremost arose then tydeus  mighty son  with either ajax in fierce prowess clad190  the cretan next idomeneus with whom  uprose meriones his friend approved  terrible as the man-destroyer mars  evæmon s noble offspring next appear d  eurypylus andræmon s son the next195  thoas and last ulysses glorious chief  all these stood ready to engage in arms  with warlike hector when the ancient king  gerenian nestor thus his speech resumed now cast the lot for all who wins the chance200  shall yield achaia service and himself  serve also if successful he escape  this brunt of hostile hardiment severe so nestor they inscribing each his lot  into the helmet cast it of the son205  of atreus agamemnon then the host 171  pray d all their hands uplifting and with eyes  to the wide heavens directed many said[6]  eternal sire choose ajax or the son  of tydeus or the king himself[7] who sways210  the sceptre in mycenæ wealth-renown d such prayer the people made then nestor shook  the helmet and forth leaped whose most they wished  the lot of ajax throughout all the host  to every chief and potentate of greece215  from right to left the herald bore the lot  by all disown d but when at length he reach d  the inscriber of the lot who cast it in  illustrious ajax in his open palm  the herald placed it standing at his side220  he conscious with heroic joy the lot  cast at his foot and thus exclaim d aloud my friends the lot is mine[8] and my own heart  rejoices also for i nothing doubt  that noble hector shall be foil d by me225  but while i put mine armor on pray all  in silence to the king saturnian jove  lest while ye pray the trojans overhear  or pray aloud for whom have we to dread  no man shall my firm standing by his strength230  unsettle or for ignorance of mine  me vanquish who i hope brought forth and train d  in salamis have now not much to learn he ended they with heaven-directed eyes  the king in prayer address d saturnian jove235 jove glorious father who from ida s height  controlest all below let ajax prove  victorious make the honor all his own  or if not less than ajax hector share 172  thy love and thy regard divide the prize240  of glory and let each achieve renown then ajax put his radiant armor on  and arm d complete rush d forward as huge mars  to battle moves the sons of men between  whom jove with heart-devouring thirst inspires245  of war so moved huge ajax to the fight  tower of the greeks dilating with a smile  his martial features terrible on feet  firm-planted to the combat he advanced  stride after stride and shook his quivering spear250  him viewing argos  universal host  exulted while a panic loosed the knees  of every trojan even hector s heart  beat double but escape for him remain d  none now or to retreat into his ranks255  again from whom himself had challenged forth  ajax advancing like a tower his shield  sevenfold approach d it was the labor d work  of tychius armorer of matchless skill  who dwelt in hyla coated with the

billow-cleaving barks incensed270  against our leader agamemnon lies  but warriors of my measure who may serve  to cope with thee we want not numerous such  are found amongst us but begin the fight to

it for he bent his point  sprang ajax then and meeting full the targe  of hector shock d him through it and beyond  he urged the weapon with its sliding edge310  athwart his neck and blood was seen to start  but still for no such cause from battle ceased  crest-tossing hector but retiring seized 174  a huge stone angled sharp and black with age  that on the champain lay the bull-hide guard315  sevenfold of ajax with that stone he smote  full on its centre sang the circling brass  then ajax far a heavier stone upheaved  he whirled it and with might immeasurable  dismiss d the mass which with a mill-stone weight320  sank through the shield of hector and his knees  disabled with his shield supine he fell  but by apollo raised stood soon again  and now with swords they had each other hewn  had not the messengers of gods and men325  the heralds wise idæus on the part  of ilium and talthybius for the greeks  advancing interposed his sceptre each  between them held and thus idæus spake[10] my children cease prolong not still the fight330  ye both are dear to cloud-assembler jove  both valiant and all know it but the night  hath fallen and night s command must be obeyed to him the son of

approach  they help us and our prayers hear in return630  but if we slight and with obdurate heart  resist them to saturnian jove they cry  against us supplicating that offence  may cleave to us for vengeance of the wrong  thou therefore o achilles honor yield635  to jove s own daughters vanquished as the brave  have ofttimes been by honor paid to thee  for came not agamemnon as he comes  with gifts in hand and promises of more  hereafter burn d his anger still the same640  i would not move thee to renounce thy own  and to assist us howsoe er distress d  but now not only are his present gifts  most liberal and his promises of more  such also but these princes he hath sent645  charged with entreaties thine especial friends  and chosen for that cause from all the host  slight not their embassy nor put to shame  their intercession we confess that once  thy wrath was unreprovable and just650  thus we have heard the heroes of old times  applauded oft whose anger though intense  yet left them open to the gentle sway  of reason and conciliatory gifts  i recollect an ancient history655  which since all here are friends i will relate  the brave ætolians and curetes met  beneath the walls of calydon and fought  with mutual slaughter the ætolian powers  in the defence of calydon the fair660  and the curetes bent to lay it waste  that strife diana of the golden throne  kindled between them with resentment fired 227  that oeneus had not in some fertile spot  the first fruits of his harvest set apart665  to her with hecatombs he entertained  all the divinities of heaven beside  and her alone daughter of jove supreme  or through forgetfulness or some neglect  served not omission careless and profane670  she progeny of jove goddess shaft-arm d  a savage boar bright-tusk d in anger sent  which haunting oeneus  fields much havoc made  trees numerous on the earth in heaps he cast  uprooting them with all their blossoms on675  but meleager oeneus  son at length  slew him the hunters gathering and the hounds  of numerous cities for a boar so vast  might not be vanquish d by the power of few  and many to their funeral piles he sent680  then raised diana clamorous dispute  and contest hot between them all alike  curetes and ætolians fierce in arms  the boar s head claiming and his bristly hide  so long as warlike meleager fought685  ætolia prosper d nor with all their powers  could the curetes stand before the walls  but when resentment once had fired the heart  of meleager which hath tumult oft  excited in the breasts of wisest men690  for his own mother had his wrath provoked  althæa thenceforth with his wedded wife  he dwelt fair cleopatra close retired  she was marpessa s daughter whom she bore  to idas bravest warrior in his day695  of all on earth he fear d not  gainst the king  himself apollo for the lovely nymph  marpessa s sake his spouse to bend his bow  her therefore idas and marpessa named  thenceforth alcyone because the fate700  of sad alcyone marpessa shared 228  and wept like her by phœbus forced away  thus meleager tortured with the pangs  of wrath indulged with cleopatra dwelt  vex d that his mother cursed him for with grief705  frantic his mother importuned the gods  to avenge her slaughter d brothers[17] on his head  oft would she smite the earth while on her knees  seated she fill d her bosom with her tears  and call d on pluto and dread proserpine710  to slay her son nor vain was that request  but by implacable erynnis heard  roaming the shades of erebus ere long  the tumult and the deafening din of war  roar d at the gates and all the batter d towers715  resounded then the elders of the town  dispatch d the high-priests of the gods to plead  with meleager for his instant aid  with strong assurances of rich reward  where calydon afforded fattest soil720  they bade him choose to his own use a farm  of fifty measured acres vineyard half  and half of land commodious for the plow  him oeneus also warrior grey with age  ascending to his chamber and his doors725  smiting importunate with earnest prayers  assay d to soften kneeling to his son  nor less his sisters woo d him to relent  nor less his mother but in vain he grew  still more obdurate his companions last730  the most esteem d and dearest of his friends  the same suit urged yet he persisted still  relentless nor could even they prevail  but when the battle shook his chamber-doors  and the curetes climbing the high towers735  had fired the spacious city then with tears  the beauteous cleopatra and with prayers 229  assail d him in his view she set the woes  numberless of a city storm d the men  slaughter d the city burnt to dust the chaste740  matrons with all their children dragg d away  that dread recital roused him and at length  issuing he put his radiant armor on  thus meleager gratifying first  his own resentment from a fatal day745  saved the ætolians who the promised gift  refused him and his toils found no reward  but thou my son be wiser follow thou  no demon who would tempt thee to a course  like his occasion more propitious far750  smiles on thee now than if the fleet were fired  come while by gifts invited and receive  from all the host the honors of a god  for shouldst thou by no gifts induced at last  enter the bloody field although thou chase755  the trojans hence yet less

resumed direct ulysses at their head  patroclus then his fellow-warriors bade820  and the attendant women spread a couch  for phœnix they the couch obedient spread  with fleeces with rich arras and with flax  of subtlest woof there hoary phœnix lay  in expectation of the sacred dawn825  meantime achilles in the interior tent  with beauteous diomeda by himself  from lesbos brought daughter of phorbas lay  patroclus opposite reposed with whom  slept charming iphis her when he had won830  the lofty towers of scyros the divine  achilles took and on his friend bestow d   but when those chiefs at agamemnon s tent  arrived the greeks on every side arose  with golden cups welcoming their return835  all question d them but agamemnon first   oh worthy of achaia s highest praise  and her chief ornament ulysses speak  will he defend the fleet or his big heart  indulging wrathful doth he still refuse840   to whom renown d ulysses thus replied  atrides agamemnon king of men 232  he his resentment quenches not nor will  but burns with wrath the more thee and thy gifts  rejecting both he bids thee with the greeks845  consult by what expedient thou may st save  the fleet and people threatening that himself  will at the peep of day launch all his barks  and counselling beside the general host  to voyage homeward for that end as yet850  of ilium wall d to heaven ye shall not find

sleep    all night the leaders of the host of greece  lay sunk in soft repose all save the chief[1]  the son of atreus him from thought to thought  roving solicitous no sleep relieved  as when the spouse of beauteous juno darts5  his frequent fires designing heavy rain  immense or hail-storm or field-whitening snow  or else wide-throated war calamitous  so frequent were the groans by atreus

with a pard s spotted hide his shoulders broad  he mantled over to his head he raised  his brazen helmet and with vigorous hand35  grasping his spear forth issued to arouse  his brother mighty sovereign of the host  and by the grecians like a god revered  he found him at his galley s stern his arms  assuming radiant welcome he arrived40  to agamemnon whom he thus address d   why arm st thou

whom great agamemnon thus replied  heaven-favor d menelaus we have need  thou and myself of some device well-framed  which both the grecians and the fleet of greece50  may rescue for the mind of jove

hands sustain d60  but haste begone and at their several ships  call ajax and idomeneus i go  to exhort the noble nestor to arise  that he may visit if he so incline  the chosen band who watch and his

who himself  should range the host soliciting the chiefs  of every band as utmost need requires   him answer d agamemnon king of men140  old warrior times there are when i could wish  myself thy censure of him for in act  he is not seldom tardy and remiss  yet is not sluggish indolence the cause  no nor stupidity but he observes145  me much expecting till i lead the way  but he was foremost now far more alert  this night than i and i have sent him forth  already those to call whom thou hast named  but let us hence for at the guard i trust150  to find them since i gave them so in charge[3]   to whom the brave gerenian chief replied  him none will censure or his will dispute  whom he shall waken and exhort to rise   so saying he bound his corselet to his breast155  his sandals fair to his unsullied feet  and fastening by its clasps his purple cloak  around him double and of shaggy pile  seized next his sturdy spear headed with brass  and issued first into the grecian fleet160  there nestor brave gerenian with a voice  sonorous roused the godlike counsellor  from sleep ulysses the alarm came o er  his startled ear forth from his tent he sprang  sudden and of their coming quick inquired165   why roam ye thus the camp and fleet alone  in darkness by what urgent need constrain d   to whom the hoary pylian thus replied  laertes  noble son for wiles renown d 242  resent it not for dread is our distress170  come therefore and assist us to convene  yet others qualified to judge if war  be most expedient or immediate flight   he ended and regaining quick his tent  ulysses slung his shield then coming forth175  join d them the son of tydeus first they sought  him sleeping arm d before his tent they found  encompass d by his friends also asleep  his head each rested on his shield and each  had planted on its nether point[4] erect180  his spear beside him bright their polish d heads  as jove s own lightning glittered from afar  himself the hero slept a wild

alarm d  instant and in wing d accents thus replied   old wakeful chief thy toils are never done  are there not younger of the sons of greece195  who ranging in all parts the camp might call  the kings to council but no curb controls  or can abate activity like thine   to whom gerenian nestor in return  my friend thou hast well spoken i have sons200  and they are well deserving i have here  a numerous people also one of whom  might have sufficed to call the kings of greece  but such occasion presses now the host 243  as hath not oft occurr d the overthrow205  complete or full deliverance of us all  in balance hangs poised on a razor s edge  but haste and if thy pity of my toils  be such since thou art younger call thyself  ajax the swift and meges to the guard210   then diomede a lion

captains of the guard but sitting all  in vigilant posture with their arms prepared  as dogs that careful watch the fold by night  hearing some wild beast in the woods[5] which hounds  and hunters

they turn d  the old chief joyful at the sight in terms225  of kind encouragement them thus address d   so watch my children and beware that sleep  invade none here lest all become a prey   so saying he traversed with quick pace the trench  by every chief whom they had thither call d230  attended with whom nestor s noble son  went and meriones invited both  to join their consultation from the foss  emerging in a vacant space they sat  unstrew d with bodies of the slain the spot235  whence furious hector after slaughter made  of numerous greeks night falling had return d  there seated mutual converse close they held  and nestor brave gerenian thus began 244    oh friends hath no achaian here such trust240  in his own prowess as to venture forth  among yon haughty trojans he perchance  might on the borders of their host surprise  some wandering adversary or might learn  their consultations whether they propose245  here to abide in prospect of the fleet  or satiate with success

leader of the fleet his gift  shall be a sable[6] ewe and sucking lamb  rare acquisition and at every board  and sumptuous banquet he shall be a guest255   he ceased and all sat silent when at length  the mighty son of tydeus thus replied   me nestor my courageous heart incites  to penetrate into the neighbor host  of enemies but went some other chief260  with me far greater would my comfort prove  and i should dare the more two going forth  one quicker sees than other and suggests  prudent advice but he who single goes  mark whatsoe er he may the occasion less265  improves and his expedients

trojan dolon named[13]  son of eumedes herald of the gods370  rich both in gold and brass but in his form  unsightly yet the man was swift of foot  sole brother of five sisters he his speech  to

spoil the dead first freely let him pass  few paces then pursuing him with speed  seize on him suddenly but should he prove  the nimbler of the three with threatening spear  enforce him from his camp

boast that he had smitten dolon first  and diomede win only second praise  he poised his lifted spear and thus exclaim d435   stand or my spear shall stop thee death impends  at every step thou canst

me alive and i will pay the price  of my redemption i have gold at home  brass also and bright steel and when report  of my captivity within your fleet  shall reach my father treasures he will give450  not to be told for ransom of his son   to whom ulysses politic replied  take courage entertain no thought of death[16]  but haste this tell me and disclose the truth  why thus toward the ships comest thou alone455 251  from yonder host by night while others sleep  to spoil some carcase or from hector sent  a spy of all that passes in the fleet  or by thy curiosity impell d   then dolon his limbs

and worn with labor have no will to watch470   to whom ulysses smiling thus replied  thou hadst in truth an appetite to gifts  of no mean value coveting the steeds  of brave æacides but steeds are they  of fiery sort difficult to be ruled475  by force of mortal man achilles  self  except whom an immortal mother bore  but tell me yet again use no disguise  where left st thou at thy coming forth

truth  simply and plainly will i utter all  hector with all the senatorial chiefs490  beside the tomb of sacred ilius sits  consulting from the noisy camp remote  but for the guards hero concerning

heralds summon d loud  the citizens to prove their just demands825  on fruitful elis and the assembled chiefs  division made for numerous were the debts  which the epeans in the weak estate  of the unpeopled pylus had incurr d  for hercules few years before had sack d[24]830  our city and our mightiest slain ourselves  the gallant sons of neleus were in all  twelve youths of whom myself alone survived  the rest all perish d whence presumptuous grown  the brazen-mail d epeans wrong d us oft835  a herd of beeves my father for himself  selected and a numerous flock beside  three hundred sheep with shepherds for them all  for he a claimant was of large arrears  from sacred elis four unrivall d steeds840  with his own chariot to the games he sent  that should contend for the appointed prize  a tripod but augeias king of men  detain d the steeds and sent the charioteer  defrauded home my father therefore fired845  at such foul outrage both of deeds and words  took much and to the pylians gave the rest  for satisfaction of the claims of all  while thus we busied were in these concerns  and in performance of religious rites850  throughout the city came the epeans arm d  their whole vast multitude both horse and foot  on the third day came also clad in brass  the two molions inexpert as yet  in feats of arms and of a boyish age855  there is a city on a mountain s head  fast by the banks of alpheus far remote  the utmost town which sandy pylus owns 286  named thryoëssa and with ardor fired  to lay it waste that city they besieged860  now when their host had traversed all the plain  minerva from olympus flew by night  and bade us arm nor were the pylians slow  to assemble but impatient for the fight  me then my father suffer d not to arm865  but hid my steeds for he supposed me raw  as yet and ignorant how war is waged  yet even thus unvantaged and on foot  superior honors i that day acquired  to theirs who rode for pallas led me on870  herself to victory there is a stream  which at arena falls into the sea  named minuëius on that river s bank  the pylian horsemen waited day s approach  and thither all our foot came pouring down875  the flood divine of alpheus thence we reach d  at noon all arm d complete there hallow d rites  we held to jove omnipotent and slew  a bull to sacred alpheus with a bull  to neptune and a heifer of the herd880  to pallas then all marshall d as they were  from van to rear our legions took repast  and at the river s side slept on their arms  already the epean host had round  begirt the city bent to lay it waste885  a task which cost them first both blood and toil  for when the radiant sun on the green earth  had risen with prayer to pallas and to jove  we gave them battle when the pylian host  and the epeans thus were close engaged890  i first a warrior slew mulius the brave  and seized his coursers he the eldest-born  of king augeias  daughters had espoused  the golden agamede not an herb  the spacious earth yields but she knew its powers895  him rushing on me with my brazen lance 287  i smote and in the dust he fell i leap d  into his seat and drove into the van  a panic seized the epeans when they saw  the leader of their horse o erthrown a chief900  surpassing all in fight black as a cloud  with whirlwind fraught i drove impetuous on  took fifty chariots and at side of each  lay two slain warriors with their teeth the soil  grinding all vanquish d by my single arm905  i had slain also the molions sons  of actor but the sovereign of the deep  their own authentic sire in darkness dense  involving both convey d them safe away  then jove a victory of prime renown910  gave to the pylians for we chased and slew  and gather d spoil o er all the champain spread  with scatter d shields till we our steeds had driven  to the buprasian fields laden with corn  to the olenian rock and to a town915  in fair colona situate and named  alesia there it was that pallas turn d  our people homeward there i left the last  of all the slain and he was slain by me  then drove the achaians from buprasium home920  their coursers fleet and jove of gods above  received most praise nestor of men below   such once was i but brave achilles shuts  his virtues close an unimparted store  yet even he shall weep when all the host925  his fellow-warriors once shall be destroy d  but recollect young friend the sage advice  which when thou earnest from phthia to the aid  of agamemnon on that selfsame day  menœtius gave thee we were present there930  ulysses and myself both in the house  and heard it all for to the house we came  of peleus in our journey through the land  of fertile greece gathering her states to war 288  we found thy noble sire menœtius there935  thee and achilles ancient peleus stood  to jove the thunderer offering in his court  thighs of an ox and on the blazing rites  libation pouring from a cup of gold  while ye on preparation of the feast940  attended both ulysses and myself  stood in the vestibule achilles flew  toward us introduced us by the hand  and seating us such liberal portion gave  to each as hospitality requires945  our thirst at length and hunger both sufficed  i foremost speaking ask d you to the wars  and ye were eager both but from your sires  much admonition ere ye went received  old peleus charged achilles to aspire950  to highest praise and always to excel  but thee thy sire menœtius thus advised  my son achilles boasts the nobler birth  but thou art elder he in strength excels  thee far thou therefore with discretion rule955  his inexperience thy advice impart  with gentleness instruction wise suggest  wisely and thou shalt find him apt to learn  so thee thy father taught but as it seems  in vain yet even now essay to move960  warlike achilles if the gods so please  who knows but that thy reasons may prevail  to rouse his valiant heart men rarely scorn  the earnest intercession of a friend  but if some prophecy alarm his fears965  and from his goddess mother he have aught  received who may have learnt the same from jove  thee let him send at least and order forth  with thee the myrmidons a dawn of hope  shall thence it may be on our host arise970  and let him send thee to the battle clad  in his own radiant armor troy deceived 289  by such resemblance shall abstain perchance  from conflict and the weary greeks enjoy  short respite it is all that war allows975  fresh as ye are ye by your shouts alone  may easily repulse an army spent  with labor from the camp and from the fleet   thus nestor and his mind bent to his words  back to æacides through all the camp980  he ran and when still running he arrived  among ulysses  barks where they had fix d  the forum where they minister d the laws  and had erected altars to the gods  there him eurypylus evæmon s son985  illustrious met deep-wounded in his thigh  and halting-back from battle from his head  the sweat and from his shoulders ran profuse  and from his perilous wound the sable blood  continual stream d yet was his mind composed990  him seeing menœtiades the brave  compassion felt and mournful thus began   ah hapless senators and chiefs of greece  left ye your native country that the dogs  might fatten on your flesh at distant troy995  but tell me hero say eurypylus  have the achaians power still to withstand  the enormous force of hector or is this  the moment when his spear must pierce us all   to whom eurypylus discreet replied1000  patroclus dear to jove there is no help  no remedy we perish at our ships  the warriors once most strenuous of the greeks  lie wounded in the fleet by foes whose might  increases ever but thyself afford1005  to me some succor lead me to my ship  cut forth the arrow from my thigh the gore  with warm ablution cleanse and on the wound  smooth unguents spread the same as by report  achilles taught thee taught himself their use1010 290  by chiron centaur justest of his kind  for podalirius and machaon both  are occupied machaon as i judge  lies wounded in his tent needing like aid  himself and podalirius in the field1015  maintains sharp conflict with the sons of troy   to whom menœtius  gallant son replied  hero eurypylus how shall we act  in this perplexity what course pursue  i seek the brave achilles to whose ear1020  i bear a message from the ancient chief  gerenian nestor guardian of the greeks  yet will i not even for such a cause  my friend abandon thee in thy distress   he ended and his arms folding around1025  the warrior bore him thence into his tent  his servant on his entrance spread the floor  with hides on which patroclus at his length  extended him and with his knife cut forth  the rankling point with tepid lotion next1030  he cleansed the gore and with a bitter root  bruised small between his palms sprinkled the wound  at once the anodyne his pain assuaged  the wound was dried within and the blood ceased    so was menœtius  gallant son employ d  healing eurypylus the greeks meantime  and trojans with tumultuous fury fought  nor was the foss ordain d long time to exclude  the host of troy nor yet the rampart built5  beside it for protection of the fleet  for hecatomb the greeks had offer d none  nor prayer to heaven that it might keep secure  their ships with all their spoils the mighty work  as in defiance of the immortal powers10  had risen and could not therefore long endure  while hector lived and while achilles held  his wrathful purpose while the city yet  of royal priam was unsack d so long  the massy structure stood but when the best15  and bravest of the trojan host were slain  and of the grecian heroes some had fallen  and some survived when priam s towers had blazed  in the tenth year and to their native shores  the grecians with their ships at length return d20  then neptune with apollo leagued devised  its ruin every river that descends  from the idæan heights into the sea  they brought against it gathering all their force  rhesus caresus rhodius the wide-branch d25  heptaporus æsepus granicus 294  scamander s sacred current and thy stream  simöis whose banks with helmets and with shields  were strew d and chiefs of origin divine  all these with refluent course apollo drove30  nine days against the rampart and jove rain d  incessant that the grecian wall wave-whelm d  through all its length might sudden disappear  neptune with his tridental mace himself  led them and beam and buttress to the flood35  consigning laid by the laborious greeks  swept the foundation and the level bank  of the swift-rolling hellespont restored  the structure thus effaced the spacious beach  he spread with sand as at the first then bade40  subside the streams and in their channels wind  with limpid course and pleasant as before   apollo thus and neptune from the first  design d its fall but now the battle raved  and clamors of the warriors all around45  the strong-built turrets whose assaulted planks  rang while the grecians by the scourge of jove  subdued stood close within their fleet immured  at hector s phalanx-scattering force appall d  he as before with whirlwind fury fought50  as when the boar or lion fiery-eyed  turns short the hunters and the hounds among  the close-embattled troop him firm oppose  and ply him fast with spears he no dismay  conceives or terror in his noble heart55  but by his courage falls frequent he turns  attempting bold the ranks and where he points  direct his onset there the ranks retire  so through the concourse on his rolling wheels  borne rapid hector animated loud60  his fellow-warriors to surpass the trench  but not his own swift-footed steeds would dare  that hazard standing on the dangerous brink  they neigh d aloud for by its breadth the foss 295  deterr d them neither was the effort slight65  to leap that gulf nor easy the attempt  to pass it through steep were the banks profound  on both sides and with massy piles acute  thick-planted interdicting all assault  no courser to the rapid chariot braced70  had enter d there with ease yet strong desires  possess d the infantry of that emprize  and thus polydamas the ear address d  of dauntless hector standing at his side   hector and ye the leaders of our host75  both trojans and allies rash the attempt  i deem and vain to push our horses through  so dangerous is the pass rough is the trench  with pointed stakes and the achaian wall  meets us beyond no chariot may descend80  or charioteer fight there strait are the bounds  and incommodious and his death were sure  if jove high-thundering ruler of the skies  will succor ilium and nought less intend  than utter devastation of the greeks85  i am content now perish all their host  inglorious from their country far remote  but should they turn and should ourselves be driven  back from the fleet impeded and perplex d  in this deep foss i judge that not a man90   scaping the rallied grecians should survive  to bear the tidings of our fate to troy  now therefore act we all as i advise  let every charioteer his coursers hold  fast-rein d beside the foss while we on foot95  with order undisturb d and arms in hand  shall follow hector if destruction borne  on wings of destiny this day approach  the grecians they will fly our first assault   so spake polydamas whose safe advice100  pleased hector from his chariot to the ground  all arm d he leap d nor would a trojan there 296  when once they saw the hero on his feet  ride into battle but unanimous  descending with a leap all trod the plain105  each gave

and with the warlike chief130  asteropæus for of all his host  them bravest he esteem d himself except  superior in heroic might to all  and now their shields adjusted each to each  with dauntless courage fired right on they moved135  against the grecians nor expected less  than that beside their sable ships the host  should self-abandon d fall an easy prey   the trojans thus with their confederate powers  the counsel of the accomplish d prince pursued140 297  polydamas one chief alone except  asius hyrtacides he scorn d to leave  his charioteer and coursers at the trench  and drove

portals by the massy bar  secured but open for reception safe  of fugitives and to a guard consign d155  thither he drove direct and in his rear  his band shrill-shouting follow d for they judged  the greeks no longer able to withstand  their foes but sure to perish in the camp  vain hope for in the gate two chiefs they found160  lapithæ-born courageous offspring each  of dauntless father polypœtes this  sprung from pirithöus that the warrior bold  leonteus terrible as gore-tainted mars  these two defenders of the lofty gates165  stood firm before them as when two tall oaks  on the high

iämenus expert in arms  orestes thöon acamas the son  of asius and oenomäus led them on 298  till now the warlike pair exhorting loud  the grecians to defend the fleet had stood180  within the gates but soon as they perceived  the trojans swift advancing to the wall  and heard a cry from all the flying greeks  both sallying before the gates they fought  like forest-boars which hearing in the hills185  the crash of hounds and huntsmen nigh at hand  with start oblique lay many a sapling flat  short-broken by the root nor cease to grind  their sounding tusks till by the spear they die  so

the embattled host to closer conflict moved505  obedient to their counsellor and king  on the other side the greeks within the wall  made firm the phalanx seeing urgent need 307  nor could the valiant lycians through the breach  admittance to the grecian fleet obtain510  nor since they first approach d it had the greeks  with all their efforts thrust the lycians back  but as two claimants of one

in which the battle hung  till jove himself superior fame at length  to priamëian hector gave who sprang  first through the wall in lofty sounds that reach d  their utmost ranks he call d on all his

before the gate  it stood no two men mightiest of a land545  such men as now are mighty could with ease  have heaved it from the earth up to a wain  he swung it easily alone so light  the son of saturn made it in his hand  as in one hand with ease the shepherd bears550  a ram s fleece home nor toils beneath the weight  so hector right toward the planks of those  majestic folding-gates close-jointed firm  and solid bore the stone two bars within  their corresponding force combined transvere555  to guard them and one bolt secured the bars  he stood fast by them parting wide his feet

  with such encouragement those grecian chiefs  the king of ocean roused then circled soon  by many a phalanx either ajax stood  whose order mars himself arriving there  had praised or pallas

crashing wood  falls under it impediment or check  none stays its fury till the level found175  there settling by degrees it rolls no more  so after many a threat that he would pass  easily through

retired  and call d vociferous on the host of troy   trojans and lycians and close-fighting sons  of dardanus oh stand not long the greeks185  will me confront although embodied close  in solid

inglorious from our country far remote280  but thoas for thine heart was ever firm  in battle and thyself art wont to rouse  whom thou observ st remiss now also fight  as erst and urge each leader of

negligence his force in fight  but haste take arms and come we must exert290  all diligence that being only two  we yet may yield some service union much  emboldens even the weakest and our might  hath oft been proved on warriors of renown   so neptune spake and turning sought again295  the toilsome field ere long idomeneus  arriving in his spacious tent put on  his radiant armor and two spears

hast thou the field  abandon d art thou wounded bring st thou home  some pointed mischief in thy flesh infixt310  or comest thou sent to me who of myself  the still tent covet not but feats of arms   to whom meriones discreet replied  chief leader of the cretans brazen-mail d 320  idomeneus if yet there be a spear315  left in thy tent i seek one for i broke  the spear even now with which erewhile i fought  smiting the shield of fierce deiphobus   then answer thus the cretan chief return d  valiant idomeneus if spears thou need320  within my tent leaning against the wall  stand twenty spears and one forged all in troy  which from the slain i took for distant fight  me suits not therefore in my tent have i  both spears and bossy shields with brazen casques325  and corselets bright that smile against the sun   him answer d then meriones discreet  i also at my tent and in my ship  have many trojan spoils but they are hence  far distant i not less myself than thou330  am ever mindful

idomeneus i know thy valor well  why speakest thus to me choose we this day  an ambush forth of all the bravest greeks  for in the ambush is distinguish d best  the courage there the timorous and the bold340  plainly appear the dastard changes hue  and shifts from place to place nor can he calm  the fears that shake his trembling limbs but sits  low-crouching on his hams while in his breast  quick palpitates his death-foreboding heart345  and his teeth chatter but the valiant man  his posture shifts not no excessive fears  feels he but seated once in ambush deems  time tedious till the bloody fight begin  even there thy courage should no blame incur[8]350 321  for should st thou toiling in the fight by spear  or falchion bleed not on thy neck behind  would fall the weapon or thy back annoy  but it would meet thy bowels or thy chest  while thou didst rush into the clamorous van355  but haste we may not longer loiter here  as children prating lest some sharp rebuke  reward us enter quick and from within  my tent provide thee with a noble spear   then swift as mars meriones produced360  a brazen spear of those within the tent  reserved and kindling with heroic fire  follow d idomeneus

 come now conduct us whither most thine heart  prompts thee and thou shalt find us ardent all950  to face like danger what we can we will  the best and most determined can no more   so saying the hero

then  upridged rides turbulent the sounding flood  foam-crested billow after billow driven  so moved the host of troy rank after rank970  behind their chiefs all dazzling bright in arms  before them priameian hector strode  fierce as gore-tainted mars and his broad shield  advancing came heavy with hides and thick-  plated with brass his helmet on his brows975  refulgent shook and in its turn he tried  the force of every phalanx if perchance  behind his broad shield pacing he might shake  their steadfast order but he bore not down 338  the spirit of the firm achaian host980  then ajax striding forth him first defied   approach why temptest thou the greeks to fear  no babes are we in aught that appertains  to arms though humbled by the scourge of jove  thou cherishest the foolish hope to burn985  our fleet with fire but even we have hearts  prepared to guard it and your populous troy  by us dismantled and to pillage given  shall perish sooner far know this thyself  also the hour is nigh when thou shalt ask990  in prayer to jove and all the gods of heaven  that speed more rapid than the falcon s flight  may wing thy coursers while exciting dense  the dusty plain they

amid the barks of greece  falling thou shalt the vultures with thy bulk  enormous satiate and the dogs of troy1010   he spake and led his host with clamor loud  they follow d him and all the distant rear  came shouting on on the other side the greeks  re-echoed shout for shout all undismay d  and waiting firm the bravest of their foes1015  upwent the double roar into the heights  ethereal and

cry of our young warriors at the ships5  grows louder sitting here the sable wine  quaff thou while bright-hair d hecamede warms  a bath to cleanse thy crimson stains away  i from yon eminence will learn the cause   so saying he took a shield radiant with brass10  there lying in the tent the shield well-forged  of valiant thrasymedes his own son  for he had borne to fight his father s shield  and arming next his hand with a keen lance  stood forth before the tent thence soon he saw15  foul deeds and strange the grecian host confused  their broken ranks flying before the host  of ilium and the rampart overthrown  as when the wide sea darken d over all  its silent flood forebodes shrill winds to blow20  the doubtful waves roll yet to neither side  till swept at length by a decisive gale[1] 342  so stood the senior with distressful doubts  conflicting anxious whether first to seek  the grecian host or agamemnon s self25  the sovereign and at length that course preferr d  meantime with mutual carnage they the field  spread far and wide and by spears double-edged  smitten and by the sword their corselets rang   the royal chiefs ascending from the fleet30  ulysses diomede and

line above line gradual and the bay  between both promontories all was fill d  they therefore curious to survey the fight  came forth together leaning on the spear  when nestor met them heavy were

which no man qualified by years mature  to speak discreetly no man bearing rule  o er such a people as confess thy sway  should suffer to contaminate his lips  i from my soul condemn thee and condemn110  thy counsel who persuad st us in the heat  of battle terrible as this to launch  our fleet into the waves that we may give  our too successful foes their full desire  and that our own prepondering scale115  may plunge us past all hope for while they draw  their galleys down the grecians shall but ill  sustain the fight seaward will cast their eyes  and shun the battle bent on

cloud-assembler  god thus to apollo spake   hence my apollo to the trojan chief275  hector for earth-encircler neptune awed  by fear of my displeasure imminent  hath sought the sacred deep else all the gods  who compass saturn in the nether realms  had even there our contest heard i ween280  and heard it loudly but that he retreats  although at first incensed shunning my wrath  is salutary both for him and me  whose difference else had not been healed with ease  take thou my shaggy ægis and with force285  smiting it terrify the chiefs of greece  as for illustrious hector him i give  to thy peculiar care fail not to rouse  his fiercest courage till he push the greeks  to hellespont and to their ships again290  thenceforth to yield to their afflicted host  some pause from toil shall be my own concern   he ended nor apollo disobey d  his father s voice from the idæan heights  swift as the swiftest of the fowls of air295  the dove-destroyer falcon down he flew  the noble hector valiant priam s son  he found not now extended on the plain  but seated newly as from death awaked  and conscious of his friends freely he breathed300  nor sweated more by jove himself revived 370  apollo stood beside him and began   say hector priam s son why sittest here  feeble and spiritless and from thy host  apart what new disaster hath befall n305   to whom with difficulty thus replied  the warlike chief but tell me who art thou  divine inquirer best of powers above  know st not that dauntless ajax me his friends  slaughtering at yonder ships hath with a stone310  surceased from fight smiting me on the breast  i thought to have beheld this day the dead  in ades every breath so seem d my last   then answer thus the archer-god return d  courage this moment such a helper jove315  from ida sends thee at thy side to war  continual phœbus of the golden sword  whose guardian aid both thee and lofty troy  hath succor d many a time therefore arise  instant bid drive thy numerous charioteers320  their rapid steeds full on the grecian fleet  i marching at their head will smooth myself  the way before them and will turn again  to flight the heroes of the host of greece   he said and with new strength the chief inspired325  as some stall d horse high pamper d snapping short  his cord beats under foot the sounding soil  accustom d in smooth-sliding streams to lave  exulting high he bears his head his mane  wantons around his shoulders pleased he eyes330  his glossy sides and borne on pliant knees  soon finds the haunts where all his fellows graze  so bounded hector and his agile joints  plied lightly quicken d by the voice divine  and gather d fast his charioteers to battle335  but as when hounds and hunters through the woods  rush in pursuit of stag or of wild goat  he in some cave with tangled boughs o erhung  lies safe conceal d no destined prey of theirs 371  till by their clamors roused a lion grim340  starts forth to meet them then the boldest fly  such hot pursuit the danaï with swords  and spears of double edge long time maintain d  but seeing hector in his ranks again  occupied felt at once their courage fall n345   then thoas them andræmon s son address d  foremost of the ætolians at the spear  skilful in stationary combat bold  and when the sons of greece held in dispute  the prize of eloquence excell d by few350  prudent advising them he thus began   ye gods what prodigy do i behold  hath hector  scaping death risen again  for him with confident persuasion all  believed by telamonian ajax slain355  but some divinity hath interposed  to rescue and save hector who the joints  hath stiffen d of full many a valiant greek  as surely now he shall for not without  the thunderer s aid he flames in front again360  but take ye all my counsel send we back  the multitude into the fleet and first  let us who boast ourselves bravest in fight  stand that encountering him with lifted spears  we may attempt to give his rage a check365  to thrust himself into a band like ours  will doubtless even in hector move a fear   he ceased with whose advice all glad complied  then ajax with idomeneus of crete  teucer meriones and meges fierce370  as mars in battle summoning aloud  the noblest greeks in opposition firm  to hector and his host their bands prepared  while others all into the fleet retired  troy s crowded host[8] struck first with awful strides375 372  came hector foremost him apollo led  his shoulders wrapt in clouds and on his arm  the ægis shagg d terrific all around  tempestuous dazzling-bright it was a gift  to jove from vulcan and design d to appall380  and drive to flight the armies of the earth  arm d with that shield apollo led them on  firm stood the embodied greeks from either host  shrill cries arose the arrows from the nerve  leap d and by vigorous arms dismiss d the spears385  flew frequent in the flesh some stood infixt  of warlike youths but many ere they reach d  the mark they coveted unsated fell  between the hosts and rested in the soil  long as the god unagitated held390  the dreadful disk so long the vollied darts  made mutual slaughter and the people fell  but when he look d the grecian charioteers  full in the face and shook it raising high  himself the shout of battle then he quell d395  their spirits then he struck from every mind  at once all memory of their might in arms  as when two lions in the still dark night  a herd of beeves scatter or numerous flock  suddenly in the absence of the guard400  so fled the heartless greeks for phœbus sent  terrors among them but renown conferr d  and triumph proud on hector and his host  then in that foul disorder of the field  man singled man arcesilaüs died405  by hector s arm and stichius one a chief[9]  of the bœotians brazen-mail d and one  menestheus  faithful follower to the fight  æneas medon and iäsus slew  medon was spurious offspring of divine410  oïleus ajax  father and abode  in phylace for he had slain a chief 373  brother of eriopis the espoused  of brave oïleus but iäsus led  a phalanx of athenians and the son415  of sphelus son of bucolus was deem d  pierced by polydamas mecisteus fell  polites in the van of battle slew  echion and agenor clonius  but paris while deïochus to flight420  turn d with the routed van pierced him beneath  his shoulder-blade and urged the weapon through   while them the trojans spoil d meantime the greeks  entangled in the piles of the deep foss  fled every way and through necessity425  repass d the wall then hector with a voice  of loud command bade every trojan cease  from spoil and rush impetuous on the fleet [10]and whom i find far lingering from the ships  wherever there he dies no funeral fires430  brother on him or sister shall bestow  but dogs shall rend him in the sight of troy   so saying he lash d the shoulders of his steeds  and through the ranks vociferating call d  his trojans on they clamorous as he435  all lash d their steeds and menacing advanced  before them with his feet apollo push d  the banks into the foss bridging the gulf  with pass commodious both in length and breadth  a lance s flight for proof of vigor hurl d440  there phalanx after phalanx they their host  pour d dense along while phœbus in the van  display d the awful ægis and the wall  levell d with ease divine as on the shore  some wanton boy with sand builds plaything walls445  then sportive spreads them with his feet abroad  so thou shaft-arm d apollo that huge work  laborious of the greeks didst turn with ease 374  to ruin and themselves drovest all to flight  they thus enforced into the fleet again450  stood fast with mutual exhortation each  his friend encouraging and all the gods  with lifted hands soliciting aloud  but more than all gerenian nestor pray d  fervent achaia s guardian and with arms455  outstretch d toward the starry skies exclaim d   jove father if in corn-clad argos one  one greek hath ever burning at thy shrine  fat thighs of sheep or oxen ask d from thee  a safe return whom thou hast gracious heard460  olympian king and promised what he sought  now in remembrance of it give us help  in this disastrous day nor thus permit  their trojan foes to tread the grecians down   so nestor pray d and jove thunder d aloud465  responsive to the old neleïan s prayer  but when that voice of ægis-bearing jove  the trojans heard more furious on the greeks  they sprang all mindful of the fight as when  a turgid billow of some spacious sea470  while the wind blow that heaves its highest borne  sheer o er the vessel s side rolls into her  with such loud roar the trojans pass d the wall  in rush d the steeds and at the ships they waged  fierce battle hand to hand from chariots these475  with spears of double edge those from the decks  of many a sable bark with naval poles  long ponderous shod with steel for every ship  had such for conflict maritime prepared   while yet the battle raged only without480  the wall and from the ships apart so long  patroclus quiet in the tent and calm  sat of eurypylus his generous friend  consoling with sweet converse and his wound  sprinkling with drugs assuasive of his pains485  but soon as through the broken rampart borne 375  he saw the trojans and the clamor heard  and tumult of the flying greeks a voice  of loud lament uttering with open palms  his thighs he smote and sorrowful exclaim d490   eurypylus although thy need be great  no longer may i now sit at thy side  such contest hath arisen thy servant s voice  must soothe thee now for i will to the tent  haste of achilles and exhort him forth495  who knows if such the pleasure of the gods  i may prevail friends rarely plead in vain   so saying he went meantime the greeks endured  the trojan onset firm yet from the ships  repulsed them not though fewer than themselves500  nor could the host of troy breaking the ranks  of greece mix either with the camp or fleet  but as the line divides the plank aright  stretch d by some naval architect whose hand  minerva hath accomplish d in his art505  so stretch d on them the cord of battle lay  others at other ships the conflict waged  but hector to the ship advanced direct  of glorious ajax for one ship they strove  nor hector him dislodging thence could fire510  the fleet nor ajax from the fleet repulse  hector conducted thither by the gods  then noble ajax with a spear the breast  pierced of caletor son of clytius arm d  with fire to burn his bark sounding he fell515  and from his loosen d grasp down dropp d the brand  but hector seeing his own kinsman fallen  beneath the sable bark with mighty voice  call d on the hosts of lycia and of troy   trojans and lycians and close-fighting sons520  of dardanus within this narrow pass  stand firm retreat not but redeem the son  of clytius lest the grecians of his arms  despoil him slain in battle at the ships 376    so saying at ajax his bright spear he cast525  him pierced he not but lycophron the son  of mastor a cytherian who had left  cytheras fugitive for blood and dwelt  with ajax him standing at ajax  side  he pierced above his ear down from the stern530  supine he fell and in the dust expired  then shuddering ajax to his brother spake   alas my teucer we have lost our friend  mastorides is slain whom we received  an inmate from cytheræ and with love535  and reverence even filia entertain d  b9 hector pierced he dies where are thy shafts  death-wing d and bow by gift from phœbus thine   he said whom teucer hearing instant ran  with bow and well-stored quiver to his side540  whence soon his arrows sought the trojan host  he struck pisenor s son clytus the friend  and charioteer of brave polydamas  offspring of panthus toiling with both hands  to rule his fiery steeds for more to please545  the trojans and their chief where stormy most  he saw the battle thither he had driven  but sudden mischief valiant as he was  found him and such as none could waft aside  for right into his neck the arrow plunged550  and down he fell his startled coursers shook  their trappings and the empty chariot rang  that sound alarm d polydamas he turn d  and flying to their heads consign d them o er  to protiaön s son astynoüs555  whom he enjoin d to keep them in his view  then turning mingled with the van again  but teucer still another shaft produced  design d for valiant hector whose exploits  had that shaft reach d him at the ships of greece560  had ceased for ever but the eye of jove  guardian of hector s life slept not he took 377  from telamonian te5cer that renown  and while he stood straining the twisted nerve  against the trojan snapp d it devious flew565  the steel-charged[11] arrow and he dropp d his bow  then shuddering to his brother thus he spake   ah it is evident some power divine  makes fruitless all our efforts who hath struck  my bow out of my hand and snapt the cord570  with which i strung it new at dawn of day  that it might bear the bound of many a shaft   to whom the towering son of telamon  leave then thy bow and let thine arrows rest  which envious of the greeks some god confounds575  that thou may st fight with spear and buckler arm d  and animate the rest such be our deeds  that should they conquer us our foes may find  our ships at least a prize not lightly won   so ajax spake then teucer in his tent580  the bow replacing slung his fourfold shield  settled on his illustrious brows his casque  with hair high-crested waving as he moved  terrible from above took forth a spear  tough-grain d acuminated sharp with brass585  and stood incontinent at ajax  side  hector perceived the change and of the cause  conscious with echoing voice call d to his host   trojans and lycians and close-fighting sons  of dardanus oh now my friends be men590  now wheresoever through the fleet dispersed  call into mind the fury of your might  for i have seen myself jove rendering vain  the arrows of their mightiest man may know  with ease the hand of interposing jove595  both whom to glory he ordains and whom  he weakens and aids not so now he leaves 378  the grecians but propitious smiles on us  therefore stand fast and whosoever gall d  by arrow or by spear dies let him die600  it shall not shame him that he died to serve  his country[12] but his children wife and home  with all his heritage shall be secure  drive but the grecians from the shores of troy   so saying he animated each meantime605  ajax his fellow-warriors thus address d   shame on you all now grecians either die  or save at once your galley and yourselves  hope ye that should your ships become the prize  of warlike hector ye shall yet return610  on foot or hear ye not the chief aloud  summoning all his host and publishing  his own heart s wish to burn your fleet with fire  not to a dance believe me but to fight  he calls them therefore wiser course for us615  is none than that we mingle hands with hands  in contest obstinate and force with force  better at once to perish or at once  to rescue life than to consume the time  hour after hour in lingering conflict vain620  here at the ships with an inferior foe   he said and by his words into all hearts  fresh confidence infused then hector smote  schedius a chief of the phocensian powers  and son of perimedes ajax slew625  meantime a chief of trojan infantry 379  laodamas antenor s noble son  while by polydamas a leader bold  of the epeans and phylides [13] friend  cyllenian otus died meges that sight630  viewing indignant on the conqueror sprang  but starting wide polydamas escaped  saved by apollo and his spear transpierced  the breast of cræsmus on his sounding shield  prostrate he fell and meges stripp d his arms635  him so employ d dolops assail d brave son  of lampus best of men and bold in fight  offspring of king laomedon he stood  full near and through his middle buckler struck  the son of phyleus but his corselet thick640  with plates of scaly brass his life secured  that corselet phyleus on a time brought home  from ephyre where the selleïs winds  and it was given him for his life s defence  in furious battle by the king of men645  euphetes many a time had it preserved  unharm d the sire and now it saved the son  then meges rising with his pointed lance  the bushy crest of dolops  helmet drove  sheer from its base new-tinged with purple bright650  entire it fell and mingled with the dust  while thus they strove each hoping victory  came martial menelaus to the aid  of meges spear in hand apart he stood  by dolops unperceived through his back drove655  and through his breast the spear and far beyond  and down fell dolops forehead to the ground  at once both flew to strip his radiant arms  then hector summoning his kindred call d  each to his aid and melanippus first660  illustrious hicetaon s son reproved  ere yet the enemies of troy arrived  he in percote fed his wandering beeves 380  but when the danaï with all their fleet  came thither then returning he outshone665  the noblest trojans and at priam s side  dwelling was honor d by him as a son  him hector reprimanding stern began   are we thus slack can melanippus view  unmoved a kinsman slain seest not the greeks670  how busy there with dolops and his arms  come on it is no time for distant war  but either our achaian foes must bleed  or ilium taken from her topmost height  must stoop and all her citizens be slain675   so saying he went whose steps the godlike chief  attended and the telamonian next  huge ajax animated thus the greeks   oh friends be men deep treasure in your hearts  an honest shame and fighting bravely fear680  each to incur the censure of the rest  of men so minded more survive than die  while dastards forfeit life and glory both   so moved he them themselves already bent  to chase the trojans yet his word they bore685  faithful in mind and with a wall of brass  fenced firm the fleet while jove impell d the foe  then menelaus brave in fight approach d  antilochus and thus his courage roused   antilochus in all the host is none690  younger or swifter or of stronger limb  than thou make trial therefore of thy might  spring forth and prove it on some chief of troy   he ended and retired but him his praise  effectual animated from the van695  starting he cast a wistful eye around  and hurl d his glittering spear back fell the ranks  of troy appall d nor vain his weapon flew  but melanippus pierced heroic son  of hicetaon coming forth to fight700  full in the bosom and with dreadful sound 381  of all his batter d armor down he fell  swift flew antilochus as flies the hound  some fawn to seize which issuing from her lair  the hunter with his lance hath stricken dead705  so thee o melanippus to despoil  of thy bright arms valiant antilochus  sprang forth but not unnoticed by the eye  of noble hector who through all the war  ran to encounter him his dread approach710  antilochus although expert in arms  stood not but as some prowler of the wilds  conscious of injury that he hath done  slaying the watchful herdsman or his dog  escapes ere yet the peasantry arise715  so fled the son of nestor after whom  the trojans clamoring and hector pour d  darts numberless but at the front arrived  of his own phalanx there he turn d and stood  then eager as voracious lions rush d720  the trojans on the fleet of greece the mind  of jove accomplishing who them impell d  continual calling all their courage forth  while every grecian heart he tamed and took  their glory from them strengthening ilium s host725  for jove s unalter d purpose was to give  success to priameian hector s arms[14]  that he might cast into the fleet of greece  devouring flames and that no part might fail  of thetis  ruthless prayer that sight alone730  he watch d to see one galley in a blaze  ordaining foul repulse thenceforth and flight  to ilium s host but glory to the greeks  such was the cause for which at first he moved  to that assault hector himself prepared735 382  and ardent for the task nor less he raged  than mars while fighting or than flames that seize  some forest on the mountain-tops the foam  hung at his lips beneath his awful front  his keen eyes glisten d and his helmet mark d740  the agitation wild with which he fought  for jove omnipotent himself from heaven  assisted hector and although alone  with multitudes he strove gave him to reach  the heights of glory for that now his life745  waned fast and urged by pallas on[15] his hour  to die by peleus  mighty son approach d  he then wherever richest arms he saw  and thickest throng the warrior-ranks essay d  to break but broke them not though fierce resolved750  in even square compact so firm they stood  as some vast rock beside the hoary deep  the stress endures of many a hollow wind  and the huge billows tumbling at his base  so stood the danaï nor fled nor fear d755  but he all-fiery bright in arms the host  assail d on every side and on the van  fell as a wave by wintry blasts upheaved  falls ponderous on the ship white clings the foam  around her in her sail shrill howls the storm760  and every seaman trembles at the view  of thousand deaths from which he scarce escapes  such anguish rent the bosom of the greeks  but he as leaps a famish d lion fell  on beeves that graze some marshy meadow s breadth765  a countless herd tended by one unskill d  to cope with savage beasts in their defence  beside the foremost kine or with the last  he paces heedless but the lion borne 383  impetuous on the midmost one devours770  and scatters all the rest[16] so fled the greeks  terrified from above before the arm  of hector and before the frown of jove  all fled but of them all alone he slew  the mycenæan periphetes son775  of copreus custom d messenger of king  eurystheus to the might of hercules  from such a sire inglorious had arisen  a son far worthier with all virtue graced  swift-footed valiant and by none excell d780  in wisdom of the mycenæan name  yet all but served to ennoble hector more  for periphetes with a backward step  retiring on his buckler s border trod  which swept his heels so check d he fell supine785  and dreadful rang the helmet on his brows  him hector quick noticing to his side  hasted and planting in his breast a spear  slew him before the phalanx of his friends  but they although their fellow-warrior s fate790  they mourn d no succor interposed or could  themselves by noble hector sore appall d   and now behind the ships all that updrawn  above the shore stood foremost of the fleet  the greeks retired in rush d a flood of foes795  then through necessity the ships in front  abandoning amid the tents they stood  compact not disarray d for shame and fear  fast held them and vociferating each  aloud call d ceaseless on the rest to stand800  but earnest more than all guardian of all  gerenian nestor in their parents  name  implored them falling at the knees of each   oh friends be men now dearly prize your place 384  each in the estimation of the rest805  now call to memory your children wives  possessions parents ye whose parents live  and ye whose parents are not all alike  by them as if here present i entreat  that ye stand fast oh be not turn d to flight810   so saying he roused the courage of the greeks  then pallas chased the cloud fall n from above  on every eye great light the plain illumed  on all sides both toward the fleet and where  the undiscriminating battle raged815  then might be seen hector and hector s host  distinct as well the rearmost who the fight  shared not as those who waged it at the ships   to stand aloof where other grecians stood  no longer now would satisfy the mind820  of ajax but from deck to deck with strides  enormous marching to and fro he swung  with iron studs emboss d a battle-pole  unwieldy twenty and two cubits long  as one expert to spring from horse to horse825  from many steeds selecting four toward  some noble city drives them from the plain  along the populous road him many a youth  and many a maiden eyes while still secure  from steed to steed he vaults they rapid fly830  so ajax o er the decks of numerous ships  stalk d striding large and sent his voice to heaven  thus ever clamoring he bade the greeks  stand both for camp and fleet nor could himself  hector contented now the battle wage835  lost in the multitude of trojans more  but as the tawny eagle on full wing  assails the feather d nations geese or cranes  or swans lithe-neck d grazing the river s verge  so hector at a galley sable-prow d840  darted for from behind jove urged him on  with mighty hand and his host after him 385  and now again the battle at the ships  grew furious thou hadst deem d them of a kind  by toil untameable so fierce they strove845  and striving thus they fought the grecians judged  hope vain and the whole host s destruction sure  but nought expected every trojan less  than to consume the fleet with fire and leave  achaia s heroes lifeless on the field850  with such persuasions occupied they fought   then hector seized the stern of a brave bark  well-built sharp-keel d and of the swiftest sail  which had to troy protesiläus brought  but bore him never thence for that same ship855  contending greeks and trojans hand to hand  dealt slaughter mutual javelins now no more  might serve them or the arrow-starting bow  but close conflicting and of one mind all  with bill and battle-axe with ponderous swords860  and with long lances double-edged they fought  many a black-hilted falchion huge of haft  fell to the ground some from the grasp and some  from shoulders of embattled warriors hewn  and pools of blood soak d all the sable glebe865  hector that ship once grappled by the stern  left not but griping fast her upper edge  with both hands to his trojans call d aloud   fire bring me fire stand fast and shout to heaven  jove gives us now a day worth all the past870  the ships are ours which in the gods  despite  steer d hither such calamities to us  have caused for which our seniors most i blame  who me withheld from battle at the fleet  and check d the people but if

weapons numberless that storm880 386  no longer but expecting death retired  down from the decks to an inferior stand  where still he watch d and if a trojan bore  fire thither he repulsed him with his spear  roaring continual to the host of greece885   friends grecian heroes ministers of mars  be men my friends now summon all your might  think we that we have thousands at our backs  to succor

from the shores of argos far remote  our camp is where the trojans arm d complete895  swarm on the plain and ocean shuts us in  our hands must therefore save us not our heels   he said and furious with his spear again  press d them and whatsoever trojan came  obsequious to the will of hector arm d900  with fire to burn the fleet on his spear s point  ajax receiving pierced him till at length  twelve in close fight fell by his single arm   such contest for that gallant bark they waged  meantime patroclus standing at the side  of the illustrious chief achilles wept  fast as a crystal

the fates ordain not that imperial troy  stoop to thy spear nor to the spear itself  of peleus  son though mightier far than thou   he said and menœtiades the wrath  of shaft-arm d phœbus shunning far

from his chariot to the ground  leap d ardent in his left a spear he bore895  and in his right a marble fragment rough  large as his grasp with full collected might  he hurl d it neither was the weapon slow 415  to whom he had mark d or sent in vain  he smote the charioteer of hector bold900  cebriones king priam s spurious son  full on the forehead while he sway d the reins  the bone that

and expired  o er whom patroclus of equestrian fame  thou didst exult with taunting speech severe   ye gods with what agility he dives910  ah it were well if in the fishy deep  this man were occupied he might no few  with oysters satisfy although the waves  were churlish plunging headlong from his bark  as easily as from his chariot here915  so then in troy it seems are divers too   so saying on bold cebriones he sprang  with all a lion s force who while the folds  he ravages is wounded in the breast  and victim of his own fierce courage dies920  so didst thou spring patroclus to despoil  cebriones and hector opposite  leap d also to the ground then contest such  for dead cebriones those two between  arose as in the lofty mountain-tops925  two lions wage contending for a deer  new-slain both hunger-pinch d and haughty both  so for cebriones alike in arms  expert brave hector and patroclus strove  to pierce each other with the ruthless spear930  first hector seized his head

or beech or ash or rugged cornel old 416  with stormy violence the mingled boughs  smite and snap short each other crashing loud  so trojans and achaians mingling slew  mutual while neither felt a wish to fly940  around cebriones stood many a spear  and many a shaft sent smartly from the nerve  implanted deep and many a stone of grasp  enormous sounded on their batter d shields  who fought to gain him he in eddies lost945  of sable dust with his huge trunk huge space  o erspread nor steeds nor chariots heeded more   while yet the sun ascending climb d the heavens  their darts flew equal and the people fell  but when he westward journey d by a change950  surpassing hope the grecians then prevail d  they drew cebriones the hero forth  from all those weapons and his armor stripp d  at leisure distant from the battle s roar  then sprang patroclus on the trojan host955  thrice like another mars he sprang with shouts  tremendous and nine warriors thrice he slew  but when the fourth time demon-like he rush d  against them then oh then too manifest  the consummation of thy days approach d960  patroclus whom apollo terror-clad  met then in battle he the coming god  through all that multitude knew not such gloom  impenetrable him involved around  behind him close he stood and with his palms965  expanded on the spine and shoulders broad  smote him his eyes swam dizzy at the stroke

impossible for how  should dust the tresses of that helmet shame  with which achilles fighting fenced his head 417  illustrious and his graceful brows divine975  but jove now made it hector s he

and phœbus loosed the corselet from his breast  confusion seized his brain his noble limbs  quaked under him and panic-stunn d he stood  then came a dardan chief who from behind  enforced a pointed lance into his back985  between the shoulders panthus  son was he  euphorbus famous for equestrian skill  for spearmanship and in the rapid race  past all of equal age he twenty men  although a learner yet of martial feats990  and by his steeds then first to battle borne  dismounted he patroclus mighty chief  first threw a lance at thee which yet life  quell d not then snatching hasty from the wound  his ashen beam he ran into the crowd995  nor dared confront in fight even the unarm d  patroclus but patroclus by the lance  and by the stroke of an immortal hand  subdued fell back toward his ranks again  then soon as hector the retreat perceived1000  of brave patroclus wounded issuing forth  from his own phalanx he approach d and drove  a spear right through his body at the waist  sounding he fell loud groan d achaia s host  as when the lion and the sturdy boar1005  contend in battle on the mountain-tops  for some scant rivulet thirst-parch d alike  ere long the lion quells the panting boar  so priameian hector spear in hand  slew menœtiades the valiant slayer1010  of multitudes and thus in accents wing d  with fierce delight exulted in his fall 418    it was thy thought

with breath  drawn faintly and dying thou didst thus reply  now hector boast now glory for the son  of saturn and apollo me with ease  vanquishing whom they had themselves disarm d1035  have made the victory thine else twenty such  as thou had fallen by my victorious spear  me phœbus and my ruthless fate combined  to slay these foremost but of mortal men  euphorbus and thy praise is only third1040  i tell thee also and within thy heart  repose it deep thou shalt not long survive  but even now fate and a violent death  attend thee by achilles  hands ordain d  to perish by æacides the

pursued of swift æacides on fire  to smite automedon but him the steeds1060  immortal rapid by the gods conferr d  a glorious gift on peleus snatch d away   nor menelaus atreus  valiant son  knew not how menœtiades had fallen  by trojan hands in battle forth he rush d  all bright in burnish d armor through his van  and as some heifer with maternal fears5  now first acquainted compasses around  her

pair  nor will i leave that service unessay d50  longer nor will i fail through want of force  of courage or of terrible address   he ceased and smote his shield nor pierced the disk  but bent his point against the stubborn brass  then menelaus prayer preferring first55  to jove[2] assail d euphorbus in his turn  whom pacing backward in the throat he struck 425  and both hands and his full force the spear  impelled urged it through his neck behind  sounding he fell loud rang his batter d arms60  his locks which even the graces might have own d  blood-sullied and his ringlets wound about  with twine of gold and silver swept the dust  as the luxuriant olive by a swain  rear d in some solitude where rills abound65  puts forth her buds and fann d by genial airs  on all sides hangs her

the bloody paunch  torn wide meantime around him but remote  dogs stand and swains clamoring yet by fear  repress d annoy him not nor dare approach  so there all wanted courage to oppose80  the force of menelaus glorious chief  then easily had menelaus borne  the armor of the son of panthus thence  but that apollo the illustrious prize  denied him who in semblance of the chief85  of the ciconians mentes prompted forth  against him hector terrible as mars 426  whose spirit thus in accents wing d he roused   hector the chase is vain here thou pursuest  the horses of æacides the brave90  which thou shalt never win for they are steeds  of fiery nature such as ill endure  to draw or carry mortal man himself  except whom an immortal mother bore  meantime bold menelaus in defence95  of dead patroclus hath a trojan slain  of highest note euphorbus panthus  son  and hath his might in arms for ever quell d   so spake the god and to the fight return d  but grief intolerable at that word100  seized hector darting through the ranks his eye  he knew at once who stripp d euphorbus  arms  and him knew also lying on the field  and from his wide wound bleeding copious still  then dazzling bright in arms through all the van105  he flew shrill-shouting fierce as vulcan s fire  unquenchable nor were his shouts unheard  by atreus  son who with his noble mind  conferring sad thus to himself began   alas if i forsake these gorgeous spoils110  and leave patroclus for my glory slain  i fear lest the achaians at that sight  incensed reproach me and if urged by shame  i fight with hector and his host alone  lest hemm d around by multitudes i fall115  for hector by his whole embattled force  attended comes but whither tend my thoughts  no man may combat with another fenced  by power divine and whom the gods exalt  but he must draw down wo on his own head120  me therefore none of all achaia s host  will blame indignant seeing my retreat  from hector whom themselves the gods assist  but might the battle-shout of ajax once  reach me with force united we would strive125 427  even in opposition to a god  to rescue for achilles  sake his friend  task arduous but less arduous than this   while he thus meditated swift advanced  the trojan ranks with hector at their head130  he then retiring slow and turning oft  forsook the body as by dogs and swains  with clamors loud and spears driven from the stalls  a bearded lion goes his noble heart  abhors retreat and slow he quits the prey135  so menelaus with slow steps forsook  patroclus and arrived in front at length  of his own phalanx stood with sharpen d eyes  seeking vast ajax son of telamon  him leftward soon of all the field he mark d140  encouraging aloud his band whose hearts  with terrors irresistible himself  phœbus had fill d he ran and at his side  standing incontinent him thus bespake   my gallant ajax haste come quickly strive145  with me to rescue for achilles  sake  his friend though bare for hector hath

keen erelong  purposing to strike off his head and cast  his trunk drawn distant to the dogs of troy  but ajax with broad shield tower-like approach d155  then hector to his bands retreating sprang  into his chariot and to others gave  the splendid arms in charge who into troy  should bear the destined trophy of his praise  but ajax with his broad shield guarding stood160  slain menœtiades as for his whelps  the lion stands him through some forest drear  leading his little ones the hunters meet 428  fire glimmers in his looks and down he draws  his whole brow into frowns covering his eyes165  so guarding slain patroclus ajax lour d  on the other side with tender grief oppress d  unspeakable brave menelaus stood  but glaucus leader of the lycian band  son of hippolochus in bitter terms170  indignant reprimanded hector thus   ah hector chieftain of excelling form  but all unfurnish d with a warrior s heart  unwarranted i deem thy great renown  who art to flight addicted think henceforth175  how ye shall save city and citadel  thou and thy people born in troy alone  no lycian shall at least in your defence  fight with the grecians for our ceaseless toil  in arms hath ever been a thankless task180  inglorious chief how wilt thou save a worse  from warring crowds who hast sarpedon left  thy guest thy friend to be a spoil a prey  to yonder argives while he lived he much  thee and thy city profited whom dead185  thou fear st to rescue even from the dogs  now therefore may but my advice prevail  back to your country lycians so at once  shall remediless ruin fall on troy  for had the trojans now a daring heart190  intrepid such as in the breast resides  of laborers in their country s dear behalf  we soon should drag patroclus into troy  and were his body from the battle drawn  in priam s royal city once secured195  as soon the argives would in ransom give  sarpedon s body with his splendid arms  to be conducted safe into the town  for when patroclus fell the friend was slain  of such a chief as is not in the fleet200  for valor and his bands are dauntless all 429  but thou at the first glimpse of ajax  eye  confounded hast not dared in arms to face  that warrior bold superior far to thee   to whom brave hector frowning stern replied205  why glaucus should a chief like thee his tongue  presume to employ thus haughtily my friend  i thee accounted wisest once of all  who dwell in fruitful lycia but thy speech  now utter d altogether merits blame210  in which thou tell st me that i fear to stand  against vast ajax know that i from fight  shrink not nor yet from sound of prancing steeds  but jove s high purpose evermore prevails  against the thoughts of man he turns to flight215  the bravest and the victory takes with ease  even from those whom once he favor d most  but hither friend stand with me mark my deed  prove me if i be found as thou hast said  an idler all the day or if by force220  i not compel some grecian to renounce  patroclus even the boldest of them all   he ceased and to his host exclaim d aloud  trojans and lycians and close-fighting sons  of dardanus oh be ye men my friends225  now summon all your fortitude while i  put on the armor of achilles won  from the renown d patroclus slain by me   so saying illustrious hector from the clash  of spears withdrew and with his swiftest pace230  departing overtook not far remote  the bearers of achilles  arms to troy  apart from all the horrors of the field  standing he changed his armor gave his own  to be by them to sacred ilium borne235  and the immortal arms of peleus  son  achilles by the ever-living gods  to peleüs given put on those arms the sire  now old himself had on his son conferr d 430  but in those arms his son grew never old240   him therefore soon as cloud-assembler jove  saw glittering in divine achilles  arms  contemplative he shook his brows and said   ah hapless chief thy death although at hand  nought troubles thee thou wear st his heavenly245  who all excels terror of ilium s host  his friend though bold yet gentle thou hast slain  and hast the brows and bosom of the dead  unseemly bared yet bright success awhile  i give thee so compensating thy lot250  from whom andromache shall ne er receive  those glorious arms for thou shalt ne er return   so spake the thunderer and his sable brows  shaking confirm d the word but hector found  the armor apt the god of war his soul255  with fury fill d he felt his limbs afresh  invigorated and with loudest shouts  return d to his illustrious allies  to them he seem d clad in those radiant arms  himself achilles rank by rank he pass d260  through all the host exhorting every chief  asteropæus mesthles phorcys medon  thersilochus deisenor augur ennomus  chromius hippothoüs

into the host of troy and shall repulse  ajax i will reward with half the spoils  and half shall be my own glory and praise280  shall also be his meed equal to mine   he ended they compact with lifted spears  bore on the danaï conceiving each  warm expectation in his heart to wrest  from ajax son of telamon the dead285  vain hope he many a lifeless trojan heap d  on slain patroclus but at length

through consternation to the host of troy  departing therefore he admonish d oft 446  meriones and the ajaces thus   ye two brave leaders of the argive host  and thou meriones now recollect810  the

he must be seen  once more in front of battle wasting wide180  with brazen spear the crowded ranks of troy  mark him and as he fights fight also ye   to whom ulysses ever-wise replied  nay urge not

fasting were a task  might foil the best for though his will be prompt  to combat yet the power must by degrees195  forsake him thirst and hunger he must feel  and his limbs failing him at every step

talthybius next  cast him into the ocean fishes  food[8]  then in the centre of achaia s sons  uprose achilles and thus spake again325   jove father dire calamities effects  of thy appointment fall on human-kind  never had agamemnon in my breast  such anger kindled never had he seized  blinded by wrath and torn my prize away330  but that the slaughter of our numerous friends  which thence ensued thou hadst thyself ordained  now go ye grecians eat and then to battle   so saying achilles suddenly dissolved  the hasty council and all flew dispersed335  to their own ships then took the myrmidons  those splendid gifts which in the tent they lodged  of swift achilles and the damsels led  each to a seat while others of his train  drove forth the steeds to pasture with his herd340  but when brisëis bright as venus saw  patroclus lying mangled by the spear  enfolding him around she shriek d and tore  her bosom her smooth neck and beauteous cheeks  then thus divinely fair with tears she said345   ah my patroclus dearest friend of all  to hapless me departing from this tent  i left thee living and now generous chief  restored to it again here find thee dead 485  how rapid in succession are my woes350  i saw myself the valiant prince to whom  my parents had betroth d me slain before  our city walls and my three brothers sons  of my own mother whom with long regret  i mourn fell also in that dreadful field355  but when the swift achilles slew the prince  design d my spouse and the fair city sack d  of noble mynes thou by every art  of tender friendship didst forbid my tears  promising oft that thou would st make me bride360  of peleus  godlike son that thy own ship  should waft me hence to phthia and that thyself  would st furnish forth among the myrmidons  our nuptial feast therefore thy death i mourn  ceaseless for thou wast ever kind to me365   she spake and all her fellow-captives heaved  responsive sighs deploring each in show  the dead patroclus but in truth herself[9]  then the achaian chiefs gather d around  achilles wooing him to eat but he370  groan d and still resolute their suit refused    if i have here a friend on whom by prayers  i may prevail i pray that ye desist  nor longer press me mourner as i am  to eat or drink for till the sun go down375  i am inflexible and will abstain   so saying the other princes he dismiss d  impatient but the sons of atreus both  ulysses nestor and idomeneus  with phœnix hoary warrior in his tent380  abiding still with cheerful converse kind  essay d to soothe him whose afflicted soul  all soothing scorn d till he should once again 486  rush on the ravening edge of bloody war  then mindful of his friend groaning he said385   time was unhappiest dearest of my friends  when even thou with diligent dispatch  thyself hast spread a table in my tent  the hour of battle drawing nigh between  the greeks and warlike trojans but there lies390  thy body now gored by the ruthless steel  and for thy sake i neither eat nor drink  though dearth be none conscious that other wo  surpassing this i can have none to fear  no not if tidings of my father s death395  should reach me who this moment weeps perhaps  in phthia tears of tenderest regret  for such a son while i remote from home  fight for detested helen under troy  nor even were he dead whom if he live400  i rear in scyros my own darling son  my neoptolemus of form divine[10]  for still this hope i cherish d in my breast  till now that of us two myself alone  should fall at ilium and that thou restored405  to phthia should st have wafted o er the waves  my son from scyros to his native home  that thou might st show him all his heritage  my train of menials and my fair abode  for either dead already i account410  peleus or doubt not that his residue  of miserable life shall soon be spent  through stress of age and expectation sad  that tidings of my death shall next arrive   so spake achilles weeping around whom415  the chiefs all sigh d each with remembrance pain d  of some loved object left at home meantime  jove with compassion moved their sorrow saw  and in wing d accents thus to pallas spake 487    daughter thou hast abandon d as it seems420  yon virtuous chief for ever shall no care  thy mind engage of brave achilles more  before his gallant fleet mourning he sits  his friend disconsolate the other greeks  sat and are satisfied he only fasts425  go then instil nectar into his breast  and sweets ambrosial that he hunger not   so saying he urged minerva prompt before  in form a shrill-voiced harpy of long

through abstinence then soar d again  to her great sire s unperishing abode435  and now the grecians from their gallant fleet  all pour d themselves abroad as when thick snow  from jove descends

thus  achilles swiftest of the swift replied   why xanthus propheciest thou my death  it ill beseems thee i already know  that from my parents far remote my doom515  appoints me here to die yet not the more  cease i from feats if arms till ilium s host  shall have received at length their fill of war   he said and with a shout drove forth to battle   the grecians thus before their lofty ships

and ask d incontinent the mind of jove[3]   king of the lightnings wherefore hast thou call d  the gods to council hast thou aught at heart  important to the hosts of greece and troy  for on the

with minds discordant juno sought  and pallas with the earth-encircling power45  neptune the grecian fleet with whom were join d  mercury teacher of all useful arts  and vulcan rolling on all sides

trojan at the sight  of swift achilles like another mars  panting for blood and bright in arms again60  but when the olympian powers had enter d once  the multitude then discord at whose voice  the

gods but most desire  achilles felt breaking the ranks to rush  on priameian hector with whose blood  chiefly his fury prompted him to sate  the indefatigable god of war100  but the encourager of ilium s host  apollo urged æneas to assail  the son of peleus with heroic might  inspiring his bold heart he feign d the voice  of priam s son lycaon and his form105  assuming thus the trojan chief address d   æneas trojan leader where are now  thy vaunts which banqueting erewhile among  our princes o er thy brimming cups thou mad st  that thou would st fight thyself with peleus  son110   to whom æneas answer thus returned  offspring of priam why enjoin st thou me  not so inclined that arduous task to cope  with the unmatch d achilles i have proved  his force already when he chased me

achilles  hand120  and by the hand of pallas who his steps  conducted and exhorted him to slay  us and the leleges[5] vain therefore proves 497  all mortal force to peleus  son opposed  for one at least of the immortals stands125  ever beside him guardian of his life  and of himself he hath an arm that sends  his rapid spear unerring to the mark  yet would the gods more equal sway the scales  of battle not with ease should he subdue130  me though he boast a panoply of brass   him then apollo answer d son of jove  hero prefer to the immortal gods  thy prayer for thee men rumor venus  son  daughter of jove and peleus  son his birth135  drew from a goddess of inferior note  thy mother is from jove the offspring his  less noble of the hoary ocean old  go therefore and thy conquering spear

radiant in arms nor pass d anchises  son  unseen of juno through the crowded ranks145  seeking achilles but the powers of heaven  convened by her command she thus address d   neptune and thou minerva with mature  deliberation ponder the event  yon chief æneas dazzling bright in arms150  goes to withstand achilles and he goes  sent by apollo in despite of whom  be it our task to give him quick repulse  or of ourselves let some propitious power  strengthen achilles with a mind exempt155  from terror and with force invincible  so shall he know that of the gods above  the mightiest are his friends with whom compared  the favorers of ilium in time past  who stood her guardians in the bloody strife160  are empty boasters all and nothing worth 498  for therefore came we down that we may share  this fight and that achilles suffer nought  fatal to-day though suffer all he must  hereafter with his thread of life entwined165  by destiny the day when he was born  but should achilles unapprized remain  of such advantage by a voice divine  when he shall meet some deity in the field  fear then will seize him for celestial forms170  unveil d are terrible to mortal eyes   to whom replied the shaker of the shores  juno thy hot impatience needs control  it ill befits thee no desire i feel  to force into contention with ourselves175  gods our inferiors no let us retired  to yonder hill distant from all resort  there sit while these the battle wage alone  but if apollo or if mars the fight  entering begin themselves to interfere180  against achilles then will we at once  to battle also and i much misdeem  or glad they shall be soon to mix again  among the gods on the olympian heights  by strong coercion of our arms subdued185   so saying the god of ocean azure-hair d  moved foremost to the lofty mound earth-built  of noble hercules by pallas raised  and by the trojans for his safe escape  what time the monster of the deep pursued190  the hero from the sea-bank o er the plain  there neptune sat and his confederate gods  their shoulders with impenetrable clouds  o ermantled while the city-spoiler mars  sat with apollo opposite on the hill195  callicolone with their aids divine  so gods to gods in opposite aspect  sat ruminating and alike the work  all fearing to begin of arduous war 499  while from his seat sublime jove urged them on200  the champain all

advanced205  impatient for the fight anchises  son  æneas and achilles glorious chief  æneas first under his ponderous casque  nodding and menacing advanced before  his breast he held the well-conducted orb210  of his broad shield and shook his brazen spear  on the other side achilles to the fight  flew like a ravening lion on whose death  resolved the peasants from all quarters meet  he viewing with disdain the foremost stalks215  right on but smitten by some dauntless youth  writhes himself and discloses his huge fangs  hung with white foam then growling for revenge  lashes himself to battle with his tail  till with a burning eye and a bold heart220  he springs to slaughter or himself is slain  so by his valor and his noble mind  impell d renown d achilles moved toward  æneas and small interval between  thus spake the hero matchless in the race225   why stand st thou here æneas thy own band  left at such distance is it that thine heart  glows with ambition to contend with me  in hope of priam s honors and to fill  his throne hereafter in troy steed-renown d230  but shouldst thou slay me not for that exploit  would priam such large recompense bestow  for he hath sons and hath beside a mind  and disposition not so lightly changed  or have the trojans of their richest soil235  for vineyard apt or plow assign d thee part  if thou shalt slay me difficult i hope 500  at least thou shalt experience that emprize  for as i think i have already chased  thee with my spear forgettest thou the day240  when finding thee alone i drove thee down  headlong from ida and thy cattle left  afar thou didst not dare in all thy flight  turn once till at lyrnessus safe arrived  which city by jove s aid and by the aid245  of pallas i destroy d and captive led  their women thee indeed the gods preserved  but they shall not preserve thee as thou dream st  now also back into thy host again  hence i command thee nor oppose in fight250  my force lest evil find thee to be taught  by suffering only is the part of fools   to whom æneas answer thus return d  pelides hope not as i were a boy  with words to scare me i have also taunts255  at my command and could be sharp as thou  by such reports as from the lips of men  we oft have heard each other s birth we know  and parents but my parents to behold  was ne er thy lot nor have i thine beheld260  thee men proclaim from noble peleus sprung  and thetis bright hair d goddess of the deep  i boast myself of lovely venus born  to brave anchises and his son this day  in battle slain thy sire shall mourn or mine265  for i expect not that we shall depart  like children satisfied with words alone  but if it please thee more at large to learn  my lineage thousands can attest it true  know this jove sovereign of the storms begat270  dardanus and ere yet the sacred walls  of ilium rose the glory of this plain  he built dardania for at ida s foot  dwelt our progenitors in ancient days  dardanus was the father of a son275 501  king ericthonius wealthiest of mankind  three thousand mares of his the marish grazed  each suckling with delight her tender foal  boreas enamor d of no few of these  the pasture sought and cover d them in form280  of a steed azure-maned they pregnant thence  twelve foals produced and all so light of foot  that when they wanton d in the fruitful field  they swept and snapp d it not the golden

sire[6]  such is my lineage and such blood i boast300  but valor is from jove he as he wills  increases or reduces it in man  for he is lord of all therefore enough   too long like children we have stood the time  consuming here while battle roars around305  reproach is cheap easily might we cast  gibes at each other till a ship that asks  a hundred oars should sink beneath the load  the tongue of man is voluble hath words  for every theme nor wants wide field and long310  and as he speaks so shall he hear again 502  but we why should we wrangle and with taunts  assail each other as the practice is  of women who with heart-devouring strife  on fire start forth into the public way315  to mock each other uttering as may chance  much truth much falsehood as their anger bids  the ardor of my courage will not slack  for all thy speeches we must combat first  now therefore without more delay begin320  that we may taste each other s force in arms[7]   so spake æneas and his brazen lance  hurl d with full force against the dreadful shield  loud roar d its ample concave at the blow  not unalarm d pelides his broad disk325  thrust farther from him deeming that the force  of such an arm should pierce his guard with ease  vain fear he recollected not that arms  glorious as his gifts of the immortal gods  yield not so quickly to the force of man330  the stormy spear by brave æneas sent  no passage found the golden plate divine  repress d its vehemence two folds it pierced  but three were still behind for with five folds  vulcan had fortified it two were brass335  the two interior tin the midmost gold  and at the golden one the weapon stood[8] 503  achilles next hurl d his long shadow d spear  and struck æneas on the utmost verge  of his broad shield where thinnest lay the brass340  and thinnest the ox-hide the pelian ash  started right through the buckler and it rang  æneas crouch d terrified and his shield  thrust farther from him but the rapid beam  bursting both borders of the ample disk345  glanced o er his back and plunged into the soil  he  scaped it and he stood but as he stood  with horror infinite the weapon saw  planted so near him then achilles drew  his falchion keen and with a deafening shout350  sprang on him but æneas seized a stone  heavy and huge a weight to overcharge  two men such men as are accounted strong  now but he wielded it with ease alone  then had æneas as achilles came355  impetuous on smitten although in vain  his helmet or his shield and peleus  son  had with his falchion him stretch d at his feet  but that the god of ocean quick perceived  his peril and the immortals thus bespake360   i pity brave æneas who shall soon  slain by achilles see the realms below  by smooth suggestions of apollo lured  to danger such as he can ne er avert  but wherefore should the chief guiltless himself365  die for the fault of others at no time  his gifts have fail d grateful to all in heaven  come therefore and let us from death ourselves  rescue him lest if by achilles  arm  this hero perish jove himself be wroth370  for he is destined to survive lest all  the house of dardanus whom jove beyond  all others loved his sons of woman born  fail with æneas and be found no more  saturnian jove hath hated now long time375 504  the family of priam and henceforth  æneas and his son and his sons  sons  shall sway the sceptre o er the race of troy   to whom majestic thus the spouse of jove  neptune deliberate thyself and choose380  whether to save æneas or to leave  the hero victim of achilles  ire  for pallas and myself ofttimes have sworn  in full assembly of the gods to aid  troy never never to avert the day385  of her distress not even when the flames  kindled by the heroic sons of greece  shall climb with fury to her topmost towers   she spake then neptune instant through the throng  of battle flying and the clash of spears390  came where achilles and æneas fought  at once with shadows dim he blurr d the sight  of peleus  son and from the shield himself  of brave æneas the bright-pointed ash  retracting placed it at achilles  feet395  then lifting high æneas from the ground  he heaved him far remote o er many a rank  of heroes and of bounding steeds he flew  launch d into air from the expanded palm  of neptune and alighted in the rear400  of all the battle where the caucons stood  neptune approach d him there and at his side  standing in accents wing d him thus bespake   what god æneas tempted thee to cope  thus inconsiderately with the son405  of peleus both more excellent in fight  than thou and more the favorite of the skies  from him retire hereafter or expect  a premature descent into the shades  but when achilles shall have once fulfill d410  his destiny in battle slain then fight  fearless for thou canst fall by none beside   so saying he left the well-admonish d chief 505  and from achilles  eyes scatter d the gloom  shed o er them by himself the hero saw415  clearly and with his noble heart incensed  by disappointment thus conferring said   gods i behold a prodigy my spear  lies at my foot and he at whom i cast  the weapon with such deadly force is gone420  æneas therefore as it seems himself  interests the immortal gods although  i deem d his boast of their protection vain  i reck not let him go so gladly  scaped  from slaughter now he shall not soon again425  feel an ambition to contend with me  now will i rouse the danaï and prove  the force in fight of many a trojan more   he said and sprang to battle with loud voice  calling the grecians after him ye sons430  of the achaians stand not now aloof  my noble friends but foot to foot let each  fall on courageous and desire the fight  the task were difficult for me alone  brave as i boast myself to chase a foe435  so numerous and to combat with them all  not mars himself immortal though he be  nor pallas could with all the ranks contend  of this vast multitude and drive the whole  with hands with feet with spirit and with might440  all that i can i will right through i go  and not a trojan who shall chance within  spear s reach of me shall as i judge rejoice   thus he the greeks exhorted opposite  meantime illustrious hector to his host445  vociferated his design to oppose  achilles publishing in every ear   fear not ye valiant men of troy fear not  the son of peleus in a war of words  i could myself cope even with the gods450  but not with spears there they excel us all 506  nor shall achilles full performance give  to all his vaunts but if he some fulfil  shall others leave mutilate in the midst  i will encounter him though his hands be fire455  though fire his hands and his heart hammer d steel   so spake he them exhorting at his word  uprose the trojan spears thick intermixt  the battle join d and clamor loud began  then thus approaching hector phœbus spake460   henceforth advance not hector in the front  seeking achilles but retired within  the stormy multitude his coming wait  lest his spear reach thee or his glittering sword   he said and hector far into his host465  withdrew admonish d by the voice divine  then shouting terrible and clothed with might  achilles sprang to battle first he slew  the valiant chief iphition whom a band  numerous obey d otrynteus was his sire470  him to otrynteus city-waster chief  a naiad under snowy tmolus bore  in fruitful hyda[9] right into his front  as he advanced achilles drove his spear  and rived his skull with thundering sound he fell475  and thus the conqueror gloried in his fall   ah otryntides thou art slain here lies  the terrible in arms who born beside  the broad gygæan lake where hyllus flows  and hermus call d the fertile soil his own480   thus gloried he meantime the shades of death  cover d iphition and achaian wheels  and horses ground his body in the van  demoleon next antenor s son a brave  defender of the walls of troy he slew485  into his temples through his brazen casque  he thrust the pelian ash nor could the brass 507  such force resist but the huge weapon drove  the shatter d bone into his inmost brain  and his fierce onset at a stroke repress d490  hippodamas his weapon next received  within his spine while with a leap he left  his steeds and fled he panting forth his life  moan d like a bull by consecrated youths  dragg d round the heliconian king[10] who

indulged500  a warrior s place for that of all his sons  he was the youngest-born his hoary sire s  chief darling and in speed surpass d them all  then also in the vanity of youth  for show of nimbleness he started oft505  into the vanward till at last he fell  him gliding swiftly by swifter than he  achilles with a javelin reach d he struck  his belt behind him where the golden clasps  met and the double hauberk interposed510  the point transpierced his bowels and sprang through  his navel screaming on his knees he fell  death-shadows dimm d his eyes and with both hands  stooping he press d his gather d bowels back  but noble hector soon as he beheld515  his brother polydorus to the earth  inclined and with his bowels in his hands  sightless well-nigh with anguish could endure  no longer to remain aloof flame-like  he burst abroad[11] and shaking his sharp spear520 508  advanced to meet achilles whose approach  seeing achilles bounded with delight  and thus exulting to himself he said   ah he approaches who hath stung my soul  deepest the slayer of whom most i loved525  behold we meet caution is at an end  and timid skulking in the walks of war   he ceased and with a brow knit into frowns  call d to illustrious hector haste approach  that i may quick dispatch thee to the shades530   whom answer d warlike hector nought appall d  pelides hope not as i were a boy  with words to scare me i have also taunts  at my command and can be sharp as thou  i know thee valiant and myself i know535  inferior far yet whether thou shalt slay  me or inferior as i am be slain  by me is at the pleasure of the gods  for i wield also not a pointless beam   he said and brandishing it hurl d his spear540  which pallas breathing softly wafted back  from the renown d achilles and it fell  successless at illustrious hector s feet  then all on fire to slay him with a shout  that rent the air achilles rapid flew545  toward him but him wrapt in clouds opaque  apollo caught with

they rush d  and fierce to battle while the boundless earth  quaked under them and all around the heavens  sang them together with a trumpet s voice455  jove listening on the olympian summit sat  well-pleased and in his heart laughing for joy 526  beheld the powers of heaven in battle join d  not long aloof they stood shield-piercer mars  his brazen spear grasp d and began the fight460  rushing on pallas whom he thus reproach d   wasp front of impudence and past all bounds  audacious why impellest thou the gods  to fight thy own proud spirit is the cause  remember st not how urged by thee the son465  of tydeus diomede myself assail d  when thou the radiant spear with thy own hand  guiding didst rend my body now i ween  the hour is come in which i shall exact  vengeance for all thy

upheaved  a rugged stone black ponderous from the plain475  a land-mark fixt by men of ancient times  which hurling at the neck of stormy mars  she smote him down he fell seven acres stretch d  he overspread his ringlets in the dust  polluted lay and dreadful rang his arms480  the goddess laugh d and thus in accents wing d  with exultation as he lay exclaim d   fool art thou still to learn how

thus in accents wing d exclaim d   i would that all who on the part of troy  oppose in fight achaia s valiant sons  were firm and bold as venus in defence  of mars for whom she dared my power defy505  so had dissension ilium overthrown  and desolated ceased long since in heaven   so pallas and approving juno smiled  then the imperial shaker of the shores  thus to apollo phœbus wherefore stand510 we

far easier is it on the mountain-heights 529  to slay wild beasts and chase the roving hind  than to conflict with mightier than ourselves  but if thou wish a lesson on that theme570  approach thou

right575  and smiling smote her with it on the ears  she writhing oft and struggling to the ground  shook forth her rapid shafts then weeping fled  as to her cavern in some hollow rock  the dove not

fears or retires  but whether from afar or nigh at hand  he pierce her first although transfixt the fight  still tries and combats desperate till she fall670  so brave antenor s son fled not or shrank  till he had proved achilles but his breast  o ershadowing with his buckler and his spear  aiming well-poised against him loud exclaim d   renown d achilles thou art high in hope675  doubtless that thou shalt this day overthrow  the city of the glorious sons of troy  fool ye must labor yet ere she be won 532  for numerous are her citizens and bold  and we will guard her for our parents  sake680  our wives and little ones but here thou diest  terrible chief and dauntless as thou art   he said and with full force hurling his lance  smote and err d not his greave beneath his knee  the glittering tin forged newly at the stroke685  tremendous rang but quick recoil d and vain  the weapon weak against that guard divine  then sprang achilles in his turn to assail  godlike agenor but apollo took  that glory from him snatching wrapt in clouds690  agenor thence whom calm he sent away   then phœbus from pursuit of ilium s host  by art averted peleus  son the form  assuming of agenor swift he fled  before him and achilles swift pursued695  while him apollo thus lured to the chase  wide o er the fruitful plain inclining still  toward scamander s dizzy stream his course  nor flying far before but with false hope  always beguiling him the scatter d host700  meantime in joyful throngs regain d the town  they fill d and shut it fast nor dared to wait  each other in the field or to inquire  who lived and who had fallen but all whom flight  had rescued like a flood pour d into troy705   thus they throughout all troy like hunted fawns  dispersed their trickling limbs at leisure cool d  and drinking slaked their fiery thirst reclined  against the battlements meantime the greeks  sloping their shields approach d the walls of troy5  and hector by his adverse fate ensnared  still stood exposed before the scæan gate  then spake apollo thus to peleus  son   wherefore thyself mortal pursuest thou me  immortal oh achilles blind with rage10  thou know st not yet that thou pursuest a god  unmindful of thy proper task to press  the flying trojans thou hast hither turn d  devious and they are all now safe in troy  yet hope me not to slay i cannot die15   to whom achilles swiftest of the swift  indignant oh of all the powers above  to me most adverse archer of the skies  thou hast beguiled me leading me away  from ilium far whence intercepted else20  no few had at this moment gnaw d the glebe  thou hast defrauded me of great renown  and safe thyself hast rescued them with ease  ah had i power i would requite thee well   so saying incensed he turned toward the town25  his rapid course like some victorious steed 536  that whirls at stretch a chariot to the goal  such seem d achilles coursing light the field   him first the ancient king of troy perceived  scouring the plain resplendent as the star30  autumnal of all stars in dead of night  conspicous most and named orion s dog  brightest it shines but ominous and dire  disease portends to miserable man[1]  so beam d achilles  armor as he flew35  loud wail d the hoary king with lifted hands  his head he smote and uttering doleful cries  of supplication sued to his own son  he fixt before the gate desirous stood  of combat with achilles when his sire40  with arms outstretch d toward him thus began   my hector wait not oh my son the approach  of this dread chief alone lest premature  thou die this moment by achilles slain  for he is strongest far oh that the gods45  him loved as i then soon should vultures rend  and dogs his carcase and my grief should cease  he hath unchilded me of many a son  all valiant youths whom he hath slain or sold  to distant isles and even now i miss50  two sons whom since the shutting of the gates  i find not polydorus and lycaon  my children by laothöe the fair  if they survive prisoners in yonder camp  i will redeem them with gold and brass55  by noble eltes to his daughter given  large store and still reserved but should they both  already slain have journey d to the shades  we then from whom they sprang have cause to mourn 537  and mourn them long but shorter shall the grief60  of ilium prove if thou escape and live  come then my son enter the city-gate  that thou may st save us all nor in thy bloom  of life cut off enhance achilles  fame  commiserate also thy unhappy sire65  ere yet distracted whom saturnian jove  ordains to a sad death and ere i die

ruthless grecian hands  me haply last of all dogs shall devour  in my own vestibule when once the spear  or falchion of some greek hath laid me low75  the very dogs fed at my table-side  my portal-guards drinking their master s blood  to drunkenness shall wallow in my courts  fair falls the warlike youth in battle slain  and when he lies torn by the pointed steel80  his death becomes him well he is secure  though dead from shame whatever next befalls  but when the silver locks and silver beard  of an old man slain by the sword from dogs  receive dishonor of all ills that wait85  on miserable man that sure is worst   so spake the ancient king and his grey hairs  pluck d with both hands but hector firm endured  on the other side all tears his mother stood  and lamentation with one hand she bared90  and with the other hand produced her breast  then in wing d accents weeping him bespake   my hector reverence this and pity me 538  if ever drawing forth this breast thy griefs  of infancy i soothed oh now my son95  acknowledge it and from within the walls  repulse this enemy stand not abroad  to cope with him for he is savage-fierce  and should he slay thee neither shall myself  who bore thee nor thy noble spouse weep o er100  thy body but where we can never come  dogs shall devour it in the fleet of greece   so they with prayers importuned and with tears  their son but him sway d not unmoved he stood  expecting vast achilles now at hand105  as some fell serpent in his cave expects  the traveller s approach batten d with herbs  of baneful juice to fury[3] forth he looks  hideous and lies coil d all around his den  so hector fill d with confidence untamed110  fled not but placing his bright shield against  a buttress with his noble heart conferr d  [4]alas for me should i repass the gate  polydamas would be the first to heap  reproaches on me for he bade me lead115  the trojans back this last calamitous night  in which achilles rose to arms again  but i refused although to have complied  had proved more profitable far since then  by rash resolves of mine i have destroy d120  the people how can i escape the blame  of all in troy the meanest there will say  539  by his self-will he hath destroy d us all  so shall they speak and then shall i regret  that i return d ere i had slain in fight125  achilles or that by achilles slain  i died not nobly in defence of troy  but shall i thus lay down my bossy shield  put off my helmet and my spear recline  against the city wall then go myself130  to meet the brave achilles and at once  promise him helen for whose sake we strive  with all the wealth that paris in his fleet  brought home to be restored to atreus  sons  and to distribute to the greeks at large135  all hidden treasures of the town an oath  taking beside from every senator  that he will nought conceal but will produce  and share in just equality what stores  soever our fair city still includes140  ah airy speculations questions vain  i may not sue to him compassion none  will he vouchsafe me or my suit respect  but seeing me unarm d will sate at once  his rage and womanlike i shall be slain145  it is no time from oak or hollow rock  with him to parley as a nymph and swain  a nymph and swain[5] soft parley mutual hold  but rather to engage in combat fierce  incontinent so shall we soonest learn150  whom jove will make victorious him or me   thus pondering he stood meantime approach d  achilles terrible as fiery mars  crest-tossing god and brandish d as he came  o er his right shoulder high the pelian spear155  like lightning or like flame or like the sun 540  ascending beam d his armor at that sight  trembled the trojan chief nor dared expect  his nearer step but flying left the gates  far distant and achilles swift pursued160  as in the mountains fleetest fowl of air  the hawk darts eager at the dove she scuds  aslant he screaming springs and springs again  to seize her all impatient for the prey  so flew achilles constant to the track165  of hector who with dreadful haste beneath  the trojan bulwarks plied his agile limbs  passing the prospect-mount where high in air  the wild-fig waved[6] they rush d along the road  declining never from the wall of troy170  and now they reach d the running rivulets clear  where from scamander s dizzy flood arise  two fountains[7] tepid one from which a smoke  issues voluminous as from a fire  the other even in summer heats like hail175  for cold or snow or crystal-stream frost-bound  beside them may be seen the broad canals  of marble scoop d in which the wives of troy  and all her daughters fair were wont to lave  their costly raiment[8] while the land had rest180  and ere the warlike sons of greece arrived  by these they ran one fleeing one in chase  valiant was he who fled but valiant far  beyond him he who urged the swift pursuit  nor ran they for a vulgar prize a beast185  for sacrifice or for the hide of such  the swift foot-racer s customary meed 541  but for the noble hector s life they ran  as when two steeds oft conquerors trim the goal  for some illustrious prize a tripod bright190  or beauteous virgin at a funeral game  so they with nimble feet the city thrice  of priam compass d all the gods look d on  and thus the sire of gods and men began   ah i behold a warrior dear to me195  around the walls of ilium driven and grieve  for hector who the thighs of fatted bulls  on yonder heights of ida many-valed  burn d oft to me and in the heights of troy[9]  but him achilles glorious chief around200  the city walls of priam now pursues  consider this ye gods weigh the event  shall we from death save hector or at length  leave him although in battle high renown d  to perish by the might of peleus  son205   whom answer d thus pallas cerulean-eyed  dread sovereign of the storms what hast thou said  wouldst thou deliver from the stroke of fate  a mortal man death-destined from of old  do it but small thy praise shall be in heaven210   then answer thus cloud-gatherer jove return d  fear not tritonia daughter dear that word  spake not my purpose me thou shalt perceive  always to thee indulgent what thou wilt  that execute and use thou no delay215   so roused he pallas of herself prepared  and from the heights olympian down she flew  with unremitting speed achilles still  urged hector as among the mountain-height  the hound pursues roused newly from her lair220  the flying fawn through many a vale and grove  and though she trembling skulk the shrubs beneath 542  tracks her continual till he find the prey  so  scaped not hector peleus  rapid son  oft as toward the dardan gates he sprang225  direct and to the bulwarks firm of troy  hoping some aid by volleys from the wall  so oft outstripping him achilles thence  enforced him to the field who as he might  still ever stretch d toward the walls again230  as in a dream[10] pursuit hesitates oft  this hath no power to fly that to pursue  so these one fled and one pursued in vain  how then had hector his impending fate  eluded had not phœbus at his last235  last effort meeting him his strength restored  and wing d for flight his agile limbs anew  the son of peleus as he ran his brows  shaking forbad the people to dismiss  a dart at hector lest a meaner hand240  piercing him should usurp the foremost praise  but when the fourth time to those rivulets  they came then lifting high his golden scales  two lots the everlasting father placed  within them for achilles one and one245  for hector balancing the doom of both  grasping it in the midst he raised the beam  down went the fatal day of hector down  to ades and apollo left his side  then blue-eyed pallas hasting to the son250  of peleus in wing d accents him address d   now dear to jove achilles famed in arms  i hope that fierce in combat though he be  we shall at last slay hector and return  crown d with great glory to the fleet of greece255  no fear of his deliverance now remains  not even should the king of radiant shafts  apollo toil in supplication roll d 543  and roll d again[11] before the thunderer s feet  but stand recover breath myself the while260  shall urge him to oppose thee face to face   so pallas spake whom joyful he obey d  and on his spear brass-pointed lean d but she  achilles left to noble hector pass d  and in the form and with the voice loud-toned265  approaching of deiphobus his ear  in accents as of pity thus address d   ah brother thou art overtask d around  the walls of troy by swift achilles driven  but stand that we may chase him in his turn[12]270   to whom crest-tossing hector huge replied  deiphobus of all my father s sons  brought forth by hecuba i ever loved  thee most but more than ever love thee now  who hast not fear d seeing me for my sake275  to quit the town where others rest content   to whom the goddess thus cerulean-eyed  brother our parents with much earnest suit  clasping my knees and all my friends implored me  to stay in troy such fear hath seized on all280  but grief for thee prey d on my inmost soul  come fight we bravely spare we now our spears  no longer now for proof if peleus  son  slaying us both shall bear into the fleet  our arms gore-stain d or perish slain by thee285   so saying the wily goddess led the way  they soon approaching each the other stood  opposite and huge hector thus began   pelides i will fly thee now no more  thrice i have compass d priam s spacious walls290  a fugitive and have not dared abide  thy onset but my heart now bids me stand  dauntless and i will slay or will be slain 544  but come we will attest the gods for they  are fittest both to witness and to guard295  our covenant if jove to me vouchsafe  the hard-earn d victory and to take thy life  i will not with dishonor foul insult  thy body but thine armor stripp d will give  thee to thy friends as thou shalt me to mine300   to whom achilles lowering dark replied  hector my bitterest foe speak not to me  of covenants as concord can be none  lions and men between nor wolves and lambs  can be unanimous but hate perforce305  each other by a law not to be changed  so cannot amity subsist between  thee and myself nor league make i with thee  or compact till thy blood in battle shed  or mine shall gratify the fiery mars310  rouse all thy virtue thou hast utmost need  of valor now and of address in arms  escape me more thou canst not pallas  hand  by mine subdues thee now will i avenge  at once the agonies of every greek315  in thy unsparing fury slain by thee   he said and brandishing the pelian ash  dismiss d it but illustrious hector warn d  crouched low and overflying him it pierced  the soil beyond whence pallas plucking it320  unseen restored it to achilles  hand  and hector to his godlike foe replied   godlike achilles thou hast err d nor know st  at all my doom from jove as thou pretend st  but seek st by subtlety and wind of words325  all empty sounds to rob me of my might  yet stand i firm think not to pierce my back  behold my bosom if the gods permit  meet me advancing and transpierce me there  meantime avoid my glittering spear but oh330  may st thou receive it all since lighter far 545  to ilium should the toils of battle prove  wert thou once slain the fiercest of her foes   he said and hurling his long spear with aim  unerring smote the centre of the shield335  of peleus  son but his spear glanced away  he angry to have sent it forth in vain  for he had other none with eyes downcast  stood motionless awhile then with loud voice  sought from deiphobus white-shielded chief340  a second but deiphobus was gone  then hector understood his doom and said   ah it is plain this is mine hour to die  i thought deiphobus at hand but me  pallas beguiled and he is still in troy345  a bitter death threatens me it is nigh  and there is no escape jove and jove s son  apollo from the first although awhile  my prompt deliverers chose this lot for me  and now it finds me but i will not fall350  inglorious i will act some great exploit  that shall be celebrated ages hence   so saying his keen falchion from his side  he drew well-temper d ponderous and rush d  at once to combat as the eagle darts355  right downward through a sullen cloud to seize  weak lamb or timorous hare so brandishing  his splendid falchion hector rush d to fight  achilles opposite with fellest ire  full-fraught came on his shield with various art360  celestial form d o erspread his ample chest  and on his radiant casque terrific waved  the bushy gold of his resplendent crest  by vulcan spun and pour d profuse around  bright as among the stars the star of all365  most radiant hesperus at midnight moves  so in the right hand of achilles beam d  his brandish d spear while meditating wo  to hector he explored his noble form 546  seeking where he was vulnerable most370  but every part his dazzling armor torn  from brave patroclus  body well secured  save where the circling key-bone from the neck  disjoins the shoulder there his throat appear d  whence injured life with swiftest flight escapes375  achilles plunging in that part his spear  impell d it through the yielding flesh beyond  the ashen beam his power of utterance left  still unimpair d but in the dust he fell  and the exulting conqueror exclaim d380   but hector thou hadst once far other hopes  and stripping slain patroclus thought st thee safe  nor caredst for absent me fond dream and vain  i was not distant far in yonder fleet  he left one able to avenge his death385  and he hath slain thee thee the dogs shall rend  dishonorably and the fowls of air  but all achaia s host shall him entomb   to whom the trojan chief languid replied  by thy own life by theirs who gave thee birth390  and by thy knees[13] oh let not grecian dogs  rend and devour me but in gold accept  and brass a ransom at my father s hands  and at my mother s an illustrious price  send home my body grant me burial rites395  among the daughters and the sons of troy   to whom with aspect stern achilles thus  dog neither knees nor parents name to me  i would my fierceness of revenge were such  that i could carve and eat thee to whose arms400  such griefs i owe so true it is and sure  that none shall save thy carcase from the dogs  no trust me would thy parents bring me weigh d  ten twenty ransoms and engage on oath  to add still more would thy dardanian sire405 547  priam redeem thee with thy weight in gold  not even at that price would i consent  that she who bare should place thee on thy bier  with lamentation dogs and ravening fowls  shall rend thy body while a scrap remains410   then dying warlike hector thus replied  full well i knew before how suit of mine  should speed preferr d to thee thy heart is steel  but oh while yet thou livest think lest the gods  requite thee on that day when pierced thyself415  by paris and apollo thou shalt fall  brave as thou art before the scæan gate   he ceased and death involved him dark around  his spirit from his limbs dismiss d the house  of ades sought mourning in her descent420  youth s prime and vigor lost disastrous doom  but him though dead achilles thus bespake   die thou my death shall find me at what hour  jove gives commandment and the gods above   he spake and from the dead drawing away425  his brazen spear placed it apart then stripp d  his arms gore-stain d meantime the other sons  of the achaians gathering fast around  the bulk admired and the proportion just  of hector neither stood a grecian there430  who pierced him not and thus the soldier spake   ye gods how far more patient of the touch  is hector now than when he fired the fleet   thus would they speak then give him each a stab  and now the body stripp d their noble chief435  the swift achilles standing in the midst  the grecians in wing d accents thus address d   friends chiefs and senators of argos  host  since by the will of heaven this man is slain  who harm d us more than all our foes beside440  essay we next the city so to learn  the trojan purpose whether hector slain  they will forsake the citadel or still 548  defend it even though of him deprived  but wherefore speak i thus still undeplored445  unburied in my fleet patroclus lies  him never while alive myself i mix  with living men and move will i forget  in ades haply they forget the dead  yet will not i patroclus even there450  now chanting pæans ye achaian youths  return we to the fleet with this our prize  we have achieved great glory[14] we have slain  illustrious hector him whom ilium praised  in all her gates and as a god revered455   he said then purposing dishonor foul  to noble hector both his feet he bored  from heel to ancle and inserting

all around long long complaints were heard  and lamentations in the streets of troy  not fewer or less piercing than if flames 549  had wrapt all ilium to her topmost towers475  his people scarce

crackling blaze ensued  all night together blowing shrill they drove  the sheeted flames wide from the funeral pile  and all night long a goblet in his hand275  from golden beakers fill d achilles stood  with large libations soaking deep the soil  and calling on the spirit of his friend  as some fond father mourns burning the bones  of his own son who dying on the eve280  of his glad nuptials

spake pelides and the chiefs complied  where er the pile had blazed with generous wine315  they quench d it and the hills of ashes sank  then weeping to a golden vase with lard  twice lined they gave

ruling his own and watching those before  now mark i will describe so plain the goal  that thou shalt know it surely a dry stump  extant above the ground an ell in height  stands yonder either oak it

for if once  thou turn the goal at speed no man thenceforth  shall reach or if he reach shall pass thee by435  although arion in thy rear he drove  adrastus  rapid horse of race divine  or those troy

encouraged loud his steeds  they flying fill d with dust the darken d air  but when returning to the hoary deep  they ran their last career then each display d  brightest his charioteership and the

it was a chasm abrupt where winter-floods  wearing the soil had gullied deep the way  thither atrides anxious to avoid  a clash of chariots drove and thither drove  also but somewhat devious from his

apace  sprinkling with dusty drops at every stroke  their charioteer while close upon their heels  radiant with tin and gold the chariot ran  scarce tracking light the dust so swift they flew630  he

sthenelus remiss635  but seizing with alacrity the prize  consign d the tripod and the virgin first  to his own band in charge then loosed the steeds 573  next came by stratagem not speed advanced  to that distinction nestor s son whom yet640  the hero menelaus close pursued  near as the wheel runs to a courser s heels  drawing his master at full speed his tail  with its extremest hairs the felly sweeps  that close attends him o er the spacious plain645  so near had menelaus now approach d  antilochus for though at first he fell  a full quoit s cast behind he soon retrieved  that loss with such increasing speed the mare  bright-maned of agamemnon æthe ran650  she had the course few paces more to both  afforded should have clearly shot beyond  antilochus nor dubious left the prize  but noble menelaus threw behind  meriones companion in the field655  of king idomeneus a lance s flight  for slowest were his steeds and he to rule  the chariot in the race least skill d of all  last came eumelus drawing to the goal  himself his splendid chariot and his mares660  driving before him peleus  rapid son  beheld him with compassion and amid  the argives in wing d accents thus he spake   here comes the most expert driving his steeds  before him just it were that he received665  the second prize tydides claims the first   he said and all applauded the award  then had achilles to eumelus given  the mare for such the pleasure seem d of all  had not the son of mighty nestor risen670  antilochus who pleaded thus his right   achilles acting as thou hast proposed  thou shalt offend me much for thou shalt take  the prize from me because the gods his steeds  and chariot-yoke disabling render d vain675  his efforts and no failure of his own 574  it was his duty to have sought the gods  in prayer then had he not following on foot  his coursers hindmost of us all arrived  but if thou pity him and deem it good680  thou hast much gold much brass and many sheep  in thy pavilion thou hast maidens fair  and coursers also of thy proper stores  hereafter give to him a richer prize  than this or give it now so shall the greeks685  applaud thee but this mare yield i to none  stand forth the grecian who desires to win  that recompense and let him fight with me   he ended and achilles godlike chief  smiled on him gratulating his success690  whom much he loved then ardent thus replied   antilochus if thou wouldst wish me give  eumelus of my own even so i will  i will present to him my corslet bright  won from asteropæus edged around695  with glittering tin a precious gift and rare   so saying he bade automedon his friend  produce it from the tent he at his word  departing to achilles brought the spoil  which at his hands eumelus glad received700  then stung with grief and with resentment fired  immeasurable menelaus rose  to charge antilochus his herald gave  the sceptre to his hand and silence bidden  to all the godlike hero thus began705   antilochus oh heretofore discreet  what hast thou done thou hast dishonor d foul  my skill and wrong d my coursers throwing thine  although inferior far by fraud before them  ye chiefs and senators of argos  host710  impartial judge between us lest of these  some say hereafter menelaus bore  antilochus by falsehood down and led  the mare away because although his steeds 575  were worse his arm was mightier and prevail d715  yet hold myself will judge and will to all  contentment give for i will judge aright  hither antilochus illustrious youth  and as the law prescribes standing before  thy steeds and chariot holding too the scourge720  with which thou drovest lay hand on both thy steeds  and swear by neptune circler of the earth  that neither wilfully nor yet by fraud  thou didst impede my chariot in its course   then prudent thus antilochus replied725  oh royal menelaus patient bear  the fault of one thy junior far in years  alike unequal and in worth to thee  thou know st how rash is youth and how propense  to pass the bounds by decency prescribed730  quick but not wise lay then thy wrath aside  the mare now given me i will myself  deliver to thee and if thou require  a larger recompense will rather yield  a larger much than from thy favor fall735  deservedly for ever mighty prince  and sin so heinously against the gods   so saying the son of valiant nestor led  the mare himself to menelaus  hand  who with heart-freshening joy the prize received740  as on the ears of growing corn the dews  fall grateful while the spiry grain erect  bristles the fields so menelaus felt  thy inmost soul a soothing pleasure sweet  then answer thus the hero quick return d745   antilochus exasperate though i were  now such no longer i relinquish glad  all strife with thee for that at other times  thou never inconsiderate wast or light  although by youthful heat misled to-day750  yet safer is it not to over-reach  superiors for no other grecian here 576  had my extreme displeasure calm d so soon  but thou hast suffer d much and much hast toil d  as thy good father and thy brother have755  on my behalf i therefore yield subdued  by thy entreaties and the mare though mine  will also give thee that these grecians all  may know me neither proud nor hard to appease   so saying the mare he to noëmon gave760  friend of antilochus and well-content  the polish d caldron for his prize received  the fourth awarded lot for he had fourth  arrived meriones asserted next  the golden talents but the phial still765  left unappropriated achilles bore  across the circus in his hand a

laertiades was born in times  long past a chief coëval with our sires  not young but vigorous and of the greeks985  achilles may alone with him contend   so saying the merit of superior speed  to

hardships oft  sustain d in fight laborious or o ercome10  with difficulty on the perilous deep   remembrance busily retracing themes  like these drew down his cheeks continual tears  now on his side he lay now lay supine  now prone then starting from his couch he roam d15  forlorn the beach nor did the rising morn  on seas and shores escape his watchful eye  but joining to his chariot his swift steeds  he fasten d hector to be dragg d behind  around the tomb of menœtiades20  him thrice he dragg d then rested in his tent  leaving him at his length stretch d in the dust  meantime apollo with compassion touch d  even of the lifeless hector from all taint  saved him and with the golden ægis broad25  covering preserved him although dragg d untorn 590    while he indulging thus his wrath disgraced  brave hector the immortals at that sight  with pity moved exhorted mercury  the watchful argicide to steal him thence30  that counsel pleased the rest but neither pleased  juno nor neptune nor the blue-eyed maid  they still as at the first held fast their hate  of sacred troy detested priam still  and still his people mindful of the crime35  of paris who when to his rural hut  they came those goddesses affronting[1] praise  and admiration gave to her alone  who with vile lusts his preference repaid  but when the twelfth ensuing morn arose40  apollo then the immortals thus address d   ye gods your dealings now injurious seem  and cruel was not hector wont to burn  thighs of fat goats and bullocks at your shrines  whom now though dead ye cannot yet endure45  to rescue that andromache once more  might view him his own mother his own son  his father and the people who would soon  yield him his just demand a funeral fire  but oh ye gods your pleasure is alone50  to please achilles that pernicious chief  who neither right regards nor owns a mind  that can relent but as the lion urged  by his own dauntless heart and savage force  invades without remorse the rights of man55  that he may banquet on his herds and flocks  so peleus  son all pity from his breast  hath driven and shame man s blessing or his curse[2] 591  for whosoever hath a loss sustain d  still dearer whether of his brother born60  from the same womb or even of his son  when he hath once bewail d him weeps no more  for fate itself gives man a patient mind  yet peleus  son not so contented slays  illustrious hector first then drags his corse65  in cruel triumph at his chariot-wheels  around patroclus  tomb but neither well  he acts nor honorably to himself  who may perchance brave though he be incur  our anger while to gratify revenge70  he pours dishonor thus on senseless clay   to whom incensed juno white-arm d replied  and be it so stand fast this word of thine  god of the silver bow if ye account  only such honor to achilles due75  as hector claims but hector was by birth  mere man and suckled at a woman s breast  not such achilles him a goddess bore  whom i myself nourish d and on my lap  fondled and in due time to peleus gave80  in marriage to a chief beloved in heaven  peculiarly ye were yourselves ye gods  partakers of the nuptial feast and thou  wast present also with thine harp in hand  thou comrade of the vile thou faithless ever85   then answer thus cloud-gatherer jove return d  juno forbear indulge not always wrath  against the gods they shall not share alike  and in the same proportion our regards  yet even hector was the man in troy90  most favor d by the gods and him no less  i also loved for punctual were his gifts  to us mine altar never miss d from him  libation or the steam of sacrifice  the meed allotted to us from of old95  but steal him not since by achilles  eye 592  unseen ye cannot who both day and night  watches[3] him as a mother tends her son  but call ye thetis hither i would give  the goddess counsel that at priam s hands100  accepting gifts achilles loose the dead   he ceased then iris tempest-wing d arose  samos between and imbrus rock-begirt  she plunged into the gloomy flood loud groan d  the briny pool while sudden down she rush d105  as sinks the bull s[4] horn with its leaden weight  death bearing to the raveners of the

friendship evermore  haste therefore seek thy son and tell him thus  the gods resent it say but most of all  myself am angry that he still detains  amid his fleet through fury of revenge150  unransom d hector so shall he at length  through fear of me perchance release the slain  myself to generous priam will the while  send iris who shall bid him to the fleet  of greece such ransom bearing as may

disconsolate while others ran160  to and fro occupied around a sheep  new-slaughter d large and of exuberant fleece  she sitting close beside him softly strok d  his cheek and thus affectionate began   how long my son sorrowing and mourning here165  wilt thou consume thy soul nor give one thought  either to food or love yet love is good 594  and woman grief s best cure for length of days  is not thy doom but even now thy death  and ruthless destiny are on the wing170  mark me i come a lieger sent from jove  the gods he saith resent it but himself  more deeply than the rest that thou detain st  amid thy fleet through fury of revenge  unransom d hector be advised accept175  ransom and to his friends resign the dead   to whom achilles swiftest of the swift  come then the ransomer and take him hence  if jove himself command it be it so   so they among the ships conferring sat180  on various themes the goddess and her son  meantime saturnian jove commanded down  his swift ambassadress to sacred troy   hence rapid iris leave the olympian heights  and finding noble priam bid him haste185  into achaia s fleet bearing such gifts  as may assuage achilles and prevail  to liberate the body

achilles slay him there  or even permit his death but will forbid  all violence for he is not unwise200  nor heedless no nor wilful to offend  but will his suppliant with much grace receive[5] 595    he ceased then iris tempest-wing d arose  jove s messenger and at the gates arrived  of priam wo and wailing found within205  around their father in the hall his sons  their robes with tears water d while them amidst  the hoary king sat mantled muffled close  and on his venerable head and neck  much dust was spread which rolling on the earth210  he had shower d on them with unsparing hands  the

with age470  my son well spoken thou hast judged aright  yet even me some deity protects  thus far to whom i owe it that i meet  so seasonably one like thee in form  so admirable and in mind discreet475  as thou art beautiful blest parents thine   to whom the messenger of heaven again  the argicide oh ancient and revered  thou hast well spoken all yet this declare  and with sincerity bear st thou away480  into some foreign country for the sake  of safer custody this precious charge  or urged by fear forsake ye all alike  troy s sacred towers since he whom thou hast lost  thy noble son was of excelling worth485  in arms and nought inferior to the greeks   then thus the godlike priam hoary king  but tell me first who thou art and from whom  descended loveliest youth who hast the fate  so well of my unhappy son rehearsed490   to whom the herald mercury replied  thy questions venerable sire proposed 603  concerning noble hector are design d  to prove me him not seldom with these eyes  in man-ennobling fight i have beheld495  most active saw him when he thinn d the greeks  with his sharp spear and drove them to the ships  amazed we stood to notice him for us  incensed against the ruler of our host  achilles suffer d not to share the fight500  i serve achilles the same gallant bark  brought us and of the myrmidons am i  son of polyctor wealthy is my sire  and such in years as thou six sons he hath  beside myself the seventh and the lots cast505  among us all mine sent me to the wars  that i have left the ships seeking the plain  the cause is this the greeks at break of day  will compass arm d the city for they loathe  to sit inactive neither can the chiefs510  restrain the hot impatience of the host   then godlike priam answer thus return d  if of the band thou be of peleus  son  achilles tell me undisguised the truth  my son subsists he still or hath thy chief515  limb after limb given him to his dogs   him answer d then the herald of the skies  oh venerable sir him neither dogs  have eaten yet nor fowls but at the ships  his body and within achilles  tent520  neglected lies twelve days he so hath lain  yet neither worm which diets on the brave  in battle fallen hath eaten him or taint  invaded he around patroclus  tomb  drags him indeed pitiless oft as day525  reddens the east yet safe from blemish still  his corse remains thou wouldst thyself admire  seeing how fresh the dew-drops as he lies  rest on him and his blood is cleansed away  that not a stain is left even his wounds530 604  for many a wound they gave him all are closed  such care the blessed gods have of thy son  dead as he is whom living much they loved   so he then glad the ancient king replied  good is it oh my son to yield the gods535  their just demands my boy while yet he lived  lived not unmindful of the worship due  to the olympian powers who therefore him  remember even in the bands of death  come then this beauteous cup take at my hand 540  be thou my guard and if the gods permit  my guide till to achilles  tent i come   whom answer d then the messenger of heaven  sir thou perceivest me young and art disposed  to try my virtue but it shall not fail545  thou bidd st me at thine hand a gift accept  whereof achilles knows not but i fear  achilles and on no account should dare  defraud him lest some evil find me next  but thee i would with pleasure hence conduct550  even to glorious argos over sea  or over land nor any through contempt  of such a guard should dare to do thee wrong   so mercury and to the chariot seat  upspringing seized at once the lash and reins555  and with fresh vigor mules and steeds inspired  arriving at the foss and towers they found  the guard preparing now their evening cheer  all whom the argicide with sudden sleep  oppress d then oped the gates thrust back the bars560  and introduced with all his litter-load  of costly gifts the venerable king  but when they reached the tent for peleus  son  raised by the myrmidons with trunks of pine  they built it lopping smooth the boughs away555  then spread with shaggy mowings of the mead  its lofty roof and with a spacious court  surrounded it all fenced with driven stakes 605  one bar alone of pine secured the door  which ask d three grecians with united force570  to thrust it to its place and three again  to thrust it back although achilles oft  would heave it to the door himself alone  then hermes benefactor of mankind  that bar displacing for the king of troy575  gave entrance to himself and to his gifts  for peleus  son design d and from the seat  alighting thus his speech to priam turn d   oh ancient priam an immortal god  attends thee i am hermes by command580  of jove my father thy appointed guide  but i return i will not entering here  stand in achilles  sight immortal powers  may not so unreservedly indulge  creatures of mortal kind but enter thou585  embrace his knees and by his father both  and by his goddess mother sue to him  and by his son that his whole heart may melt   so hermes spake and to the skies again  ascended then leap d priam to the ground590  leaving idæus he the mules and steeds  watch d while the ancient king into the tent  proceeded of achilles dear to jove  him there he found and sitting found apart  his fellow-warriors of whom two alone595  served at his side alcimus branch of mars  and brave automedon he had himself  supp d newly and the board stood unremoved  unseen of all huge priam enter d stood  near to achilles clasp d his knees and kiss d600  those terrible and homicidal hands  that had destroy d so many of his sons  as when a fugitive for blood the house  of some chief enters in a foreign land  all gaze astonish d at the sudden guest605  so gazed achilles seeing priam there 606  and so stood all astonish d each his eyes  in silence fastening on his fellow s face  but priam kneel d and suppliant thus began   think oh achilles semblance of the gods610  on thy own father full of days like me  and trembling on the gloomy verge of life[12]  some neighbor chief it may be even now  oppresses him and there is none at hand  no friend to suocor him in his distress615  yet doubtless hearing that achilles lives  he still rejoices hoping day by day  that one day he shall see the face again  of his own son from distant troy return d  but me no comfort cheers whose bravest sons620  so late the flower of ilium all are slain  when greece came hither i had fifty sons  nineteen were children of one bed the rest  born of my concubines a numerous house  but fiery mars hath thinn d it one i had625  one more than all my sons the strength of troy  whom standing for his country thou hast slain   hector his body to redeem i come  into achaia s fleet bringing myself  ransom inestimable to thy tent630  reverence the gods achilles recollect  thy father for his sake compassion show  to me more pitiable still who draw  home to my lips humiliation yet  unseen on earth his hand who slew my son635   so saying he waken d in his soul regret  of his own sire softly he placed his hand  on priam s hand and push d him gently away 607  remembrance melted both rolling before  achilles  feet priam his son deplored640  wide-slaughtering hector and achilles wept  by turns his father and by turns his friend  patroclus sounds of sorrow fill d the tent  but when at length satiate achilles felt  his heart from grief and all his frame relieved645  upstarting from his seat with pity moved  of priam s silver locks and silver beard  he raised the ancient father by his hand  whom in wing d accents kind he thus bespake   wretched indeed ah what must thou have felt650  how hast thou dared to seek alone the fleet  of the achaians and his face by whom  so many of thy valiant sons have fallen  thou hast a heart of iron terror-proof  come sit beside me let us if we may665  great mourners both bid sorrow sleep awhile  there is no profit of our sighs and tears  for thus exempt from care themselves the gods  ordain man s miserable race to mourn  fast by the threshold of jove s courts are placed660  two casks one stored with evil one with good  from which the god dispenses as he wills  for whom the glorious thunderer mingles both  he leads a life checker d with good and ill  alternate but to whom he gives unmixt665  the bitter cup he makes that man a curse  his name becomes a by-word of reproach  his strength is hunger-bitten and he walks  the blessed earth unblest go where he may  so was my father peleus at his birth670  nobly endow d with plenty and with wealth  distinguish d by the gods past all mankind  lord of the myrmidons and though a man  yet match d from heaven with an immortal bride  but even him the gods afflict a son675  refusing him who might possess his throne 608  hereafter for myself his only heir  pass as a dream and while i live instead  of solacing his age here sit before  your distant walls the scourge of thee and thine680  thee also ancient priam we have heard  reported once possessor of such wealth  as neither lesbos seat of macar owns  nor eastern phrygia nor yet all the ports  of hellespont but thou didst pass them all685  in riches and in number of thy sons  but since the powers of heaven brought on thy land  this fatal war battle and deeds of death  always surround the city where thou reign st  cease therefore from unprofitable tears690  which ere they raise thy son to life again  shall doubtless find fresh cause for which to flow   to whom the ancient king godlike replied  hero forbear no seat is here for me  while hector lies unburied in your camp695  loose him and loose him now that with these eyes  i may behold my son accept a price  magnificent which may st thou long enjoy  and since my life was precious in thy sight  may st thou revisit safe thy native shore700   to whom achilles lowering and in wrath[13]  urge me no longer at a time like this  with that harsh note i am already inclin d  to loose him thetis my own mother came  herself on that same errand sent from jove705  priam i understand thee well i know  that by some god conducted thou hast reach d  achaia s fleet for without aid divine  no mortal even in his prime of youth  had dared the attempt guards vigilant as ours710 609  he should not easily elude such gates  so massy should not easily unbar  thou therefore vex me not in my distress  lest i abhor to see thee in my tent  and borne beyond all limits set at nought715  thee and thy prayer and the command of jove   he said the old king trembled and obey d  then sprang pelides like a lion forth  not sole but with his two attendant friends  alcimus and automedon the brave720  for them patroclus slain he honor d most  of all the myrmidons they from the yoke  released both steeds and mules then introduced  and placed the herald of the hoary king  they lighten d next the litter of its charge725  inestimable leaving yet behind  two mantles and a vest that not unveil d  the body might be borne back into troy  then calling forth his women them he bade  lave and anoint the body but apart730  lest haply priam noticing his son  through stress of grief should give resentment scope  and irritate by some affront himself  to slay him in despite of jove s commands[14]  they therefore laving and anointing first735  the body cover d it with cloak and vest  then peleus  son disposed it on the bier  lifting it from the ground and his two friends  together heaved it to the royal wain  achilles last groaning his friend invoked740 610    patroclus should the tidings reach thine ear  although in ades that i have released  the noble hector at his father s suit  resent it not no sordid gifts have paid  his ransom-price which thou shalt also share745   so saying achilles to his tent return d  and on the splendid couch whence he had risen  again reclined opposite to the seat  of priam whom the hero thus bespake   priam at thy request thy son is loosed750  and lying on his bier at dawn of day  thou shalt both see him and convey him hence  thyself to troy but take we now repast  for even bright-hair d niobe her food  forgat not though of

venerable guest take we  refreshment also once arrived in troy  with thy dear son thou shalt have time to weep775  sufficient nor without most weighty cause   so spake achilles and upstarting slew  a sheep white-fleeced which his attendants flay d 611  and busily and with much skill their task  administ ring first scored the viands well780  then pierced them with the spits and when the roast  was finish d drew them from the spits again  and now automedon dispensed around  the polish d board bread in neat baskets piled  which done achilles portion d out to each785  his share and all assail d the ready feast  but when nor hunger more nor thirst they felt  dardanian priam wond ring at his bulk  and beauty for he seem d some god from heaven  gazed on achilles while achilles held790  not less in admiration of his looks  benign and of his gentle converse wise  gazed on dardanian priam and at length  the eyes of each gratified to the full  the ancient king thus to achilles spake795   hero dismiss us now each to our bed  that there at ease reclined we may enjoy  sweet sleep for never have these eyelids closed  since hector fell and died but without cease  i mourn and nourishing unnumber d woes800  have roll d me in the ashes of my courts  but i have now both tasted food and given  wine to my lips untasted till with thee   so he and at his word achilles bade  his train beneath his portico prepare805  with all dispatch two couches purple rugs  and arras and warm mantles over all  forth went the women bearing lights and spread  a couch for each when feigning needful fear[15]  achilles thus his speech to priam turn d810   my aged guest beloved sleep thou without 612  lest some achaian chief for such are wont  ofttimes here sitting to consult with me  hither repair of whom should any chance  to spy thee through the gloom he would at once815  convey the tale to agamemnon s ear  whence hindrance might arise and the release  haply of hector s body be delay d  but answer me with truth how many days  wouldst thou assign to the funereal rites820  of noble hector for so long i mean  myself to rest and keep the host at home   then thus the ancient king godlike replied  if thou indeed be willing that we give  burial to noble hector by an act825  so generous o achilles me thou shalt  much gratify for we are shut thou know st  in ilium close and fuel must procure  from ida s side remote fear too hath seized  on all our people therefore thus i say830  nine days we wish to mourn him in the house  to his interment we would give the tenth  and to the public banquet the eleventh  shall see us build his tomb and on the twelfth  if war we must we will to war again835   to whom achilles matchless in the race  so be it ancient priam i will curb  twelve days the rage of war at thy desire[16]   he spake and at his wrist the right hand grasp d  of the old sovereign to dispel his fear840  then in the vestibule the herald slept  and priam prudent both but peleus  son  in the interior tent and at his side  brisëis with transcendent beauty adorn d 613    now all all night by gentle sleep subdued845  both gods and chariot-ruling warriors lay  but not the benefactor of mankind  hermes him sleep seized not but deep he mused  how likeliest from amid the grecian fleet  he might deliver by the guard unseen850  the king of ilium at his head he stood  in vision and the senior thus bespake   ah heedless and secure hast thou no dread  of mischief ancient king that thus by foes  thou sleep st surrounded lull d by the consent855  and sufferance of achilles thou hast given  much for redemption of thy darling son  but thrice that sum thy sons who still survive  must give to agamemnon and the greeks  for thy redemption should they know thee here860   he ended at the sound alarm d upsprang  the king and roused his herald hermes yoked  himself both mules and steeds and through the camp  drove them incontinent by all unseen   soon as the windings of the stream they reach d865  deep-eddied xanthus progeny of jove  mercury the olympian summit sought  and saffron-vested morn o erspread the earth  they loud lamenting to the city drove  their steeds the mules close

through the streets  she ran of troy and loud proclaim d the sight880  ye sons of ilium and ye daughters haste 614  haste all to look on hector if ye e er  with joy beheld him while he yet survived  from fight returning for all ilium erst  in him and all her citizens rejoiced885   she spake then neither male nor female more  in troy remain d such sorrow seized on all  issuing from the city-gate they met  priam conducting sad the body home  and foremost of them all the mother flew890  and wife of hector to the bier on which  their torn-off tresses with unsparing hands  they shower d while all the people wept around  all day and to the going down of day  they thus had mourn d the dead before the gates895  had not their sovereign from his chariot-seat  thus spoken to the multitude around   fall back on either side and let the mules  pass on the body in my palace once  deposited ye then may weep your fill900   he said they opening gave the litter way  arrived within the royal house they stretch d  the breathless hector on a sumptuous bed  and singers placed beside him who should chant  the strain funereal they with many a groan905  the dirge began and still at every close  the female train with many a groan replied  then in the midst andromache white-arm d  between her palms the dreadful hector s head  pressing her lamentation thus began910  [17]my hero thou hast fallen in prime

never into fight930  a milky mind and for that self-same cause  is now bewail d in every house of troy  sorrow unutterable thou hast caused  thy parents hector but to me hast left  largest bequest of misery to whom935  dying thou neither didst thy arms extend  forth from thy bed nor gavest me precious word  to be remember d day and night with tears   so spake she weeping whom her maidens all  with sighs accompanied and her complaint940  mingled with sobs hecuba next began   ah hector dearest to thy mother s heart  of all her sons much must the gods have loved  thee living whom though dead they

have come drawn hither by report which spake thy sire arrived though still it seems the adverse gods his homeward course retard for not yet breathless lies the noble chief but in some island of the boundless flood resides a prisoner by barbarous force 250 of some rude race detained reluctant there and i will now foreshow thee what the gods teach me and what though neither augur skill d nor

multitude behold i here a banquet or a nuptial for these meet not by contribution3 to regale with such brutality and din they hold their riotous banquet a wise man and good arriving now among them at the sight of such enormities would much be wroth to whom replied telemachus discrete 290 since stranger thou hast ask d learn also this while yet ulysses with his people dwelt his presence warranted the hope that here virtue should dwell and opulence but heav n hath cast for us at length a diff rent lot and he is lost as never man before for i should less lament even his death had he among his

harpies torn inglorious beyond reach of eye or ear he lies and hath to me grief only and unceasing sighs bequeath d nor mourn i for his sake alone the gods have plann d for me still many a woe beside for all the rulers of the neighbour isles samos dulichium and the forest-crown d zacynthus others also rulers here 310 in craggy ithaca my mother seek in marriage and my household stores consume but neither she those nuptial rites abhorr d refuses absolute nor yet consents to end them they my patrimony waste meantime and will not long spare even me  to whom with deep commiseration pang d pallas

when first i saw him drinking joyous at our board from ilus son of mermeris who dwelt in distant ephyre just then return d for thither also had ulysses gone in his swift bark seeking some pois nous drug wherewith to taint his brazen arrows keen which drug through fear of the eternal gods ilus refused him and my father free 330 gave to him for he loved him past belief could now ulysses clad in arms as then mix with these suitors short his date of life to each and bitter should his nuptials prove but these events whether he shall return to take just vengeance under his own roof or whether not lie all in the gods lap meantime i counsel thee thyself to think by what means likeliest thou shalt expel these from thy doors now mark me close attend 340 to-morrow summoning the grecian chiefs to council speak to them and call the gods to witness that solemnity bid go the suitors hence each to his own abode thy mother if her purpose be resolved on marriage let her to the house return of her own potent father who himself shall furnish forth her matrimonial rites and ample dow r such as it well becomes a darling daughter to receive bestow 350 but hear me now thyself i thus advise the prime of all thy ships preparing mann d with twenty rowers voyage hence to seek intelligence of thy long-absent sire some mortal may inform thee or a word4 perchance by jove directed safest source  of notice to mankind may reach thine ear first voyaging to pylus there enquire of noble nestor thence to sparta tend to question menelaus amber-hair d 360 latest arrived of all the host of greece there should st thou learn that still thy father lives and hope of his return although distress d thou wilt be patient yet a year but should st thou there hear tidings that he breathes no longer to thy native isle return d first heap his tomb then with such pomp perform his funeral rites as his great name demands and make thy mother s spousals next thy care these duties satisfied delib rate last 370 whether thou shalt these troublers of thy house by stratagem or by assault destroy for thou art now no child nor longer may st sport like one hast thou not the proud report heard how orestes hath renown acquired with all mankind his father s murtherer ægisthus slaying the deceiver base who slaughter d agamemnon oh my friend for with delight thy vig rous growth i view and just proportion be thou also bold 380 and merit praise from ages yet to come but i will to my vessel now repair and to my mariners whom absent long i may perchance have troubled weigh thou well my counsel let not my advice be lost to whom telemachus discrete replied stranger thy words bespeak thee much my friend who as a father teaches his own son hast taught me and i never will forget but though in haste thy voyage to pursue 390 yet stay that in the bath refreshing first thy limbs now weary thou may st sprightlier seek thy gallant bark charged with some noble gift of finish d workmanship which thou shalt keep as my memorial ever such a boon as men confer on guests whom much they love then pallas thus goddess cærulean-eyed retard me not for go i must the gift which liberal thou desirest to bestow  give me at my return that i may bear 400 the treasure home and in exchange thyself expect some gift equivalent from me she spake and as with eagle-wings upborne vanish d incontinent but him inspired with daring fortitude and on his heart dearer remembrance of his sire impress d than ever conscious of the wond rous change amazed he stood and in his secret thought revolving all believed his guest a god the youthful hero to the suitors then 410 repair d they silent listen d to the song of the illustrious bard he the return deplorable of the achaian host from ilium by command of pallas sang penelope icarius  daughter mark d meantime the song celestial where she sat in the superior palace down she came by all the num rous steps of her abode not sole for two fair handmaids follow d her she then divinest of her sex arrived 420 in presence of that lawless throng beneath the portal of her stately mansion stood between her maidens with her lucid veil her lovely features mantling there profuse she wept and thus the sacred bard bespake phemius for many a sorrow-soothing strain thou know st beside such as exploits record of gods and men the poet s frequent theme give them of those a song and let themselves their wine drink noiseless but this mournful strain 430 break off unfriendly to my bosom s peace and which of all hearts nearest touches mine with such regret my dearest lord i mourn rememb ring still an husband praised from side to side and in the very heart of greece then answer thus telemachus return d my mother wherefore should it give thee pain if the delightful bard that theme pursue to which he feels his mind impell d the bard blame not but rather jove who as he wills 440 materials for poetic art supplies no fault is his if the disastrous fate  he sing of the achaians for the song wins ever from the hearers most applause that has been least in use of all who fought at troy ulysses hath not lost alone his day of glad return but many a chief hath perish d also seek thou then again thy own apartment spindle ply and loom and task thy maidens management belongs 450 to men of joys convivial and of men especially to me chief ruler here she heard astonish d and the prudent speech reposing of her son deep in her heart again with her attendant maidens sought her upper chamber there arrived she wept her lost ulysses till minerva bathed her weary lids in dewy sleep profound then echoed through the palace dark-bedimm d with evening shades the suitors boist rous roar 460 for each the royal bed burn d to partake whom thus telemachus discrete address d all ye my mother s suitors though addict to contumacious wrangling fierce suspend your clamour for a course to me it seems more decent far when such a bard as this godlike for sweetness sings to hear his song to-morrow meet we in full council all that i may plainly warn you to depart from this our mansion seek ye where ye may 470 your feasts consume your own alternate feed each at the other s cost but if it seem wisest in your account and best to eat voracious thus the patrimonial goods of one man rend ring no account of all5 bite to the roots but know that i will cry ceaseless to the eternal gods in hope that jove for retribution of the wrong shall doom you where ye have intruded there to bleed and of your blood ask no account5 480 he ended and each gnaw d his lip aghast  at his undaunted hardiness of speech then thus antinoüs spake eupithes  son telemachus the gods methinks themselves teach thee sublimity and to pronounce thy matter fearless ah forbid it jove that one so eloquent should with the weight of kingly cares in ithaca be charged a realm by claim hereditary thine then prudent thus telemachus replied 490 although my speech antinoüs may perchance provoke thee know that i am not averse from kingly cares if jove appoint me such seems it to thee a burthen to be fear d by men above all others trust me no there is no ill in royalty the man so station d waits not long ere he obtain riches and honour but i grant that kings of the achaians may no few be found in sea-girt ithaca both young and old 500 of whom since great ulysses is no more reign whoso may but king myself i am in my own house and over all my own domestics by ulysses gained for me to whom eurymachus replied the son of polybus what grecian chief shall reign in sea-girt ithaca must be referr d to the gods  will telemachus meantime thou hast unquestionable right to keep thy own and to command in thy own house 510 may never that man on her shores arrive while an inhabitant shall yet be left in ithaca who shall by violence wrest thine from thee but permit me noble sir to ask thee of thy guest whence came the man what country claims him where are to be found his kindred and his patrimonial fields brings he glad tidings of thy sire s approach homeward or came he to receive a debt due to himself how swift he disappear d 520 nor opportunity to know him gave to those who wish d it for his face and air him speak not of plebeian birth obscure whom answered thus telemachus discrete  eurymachus my father comes no more i can no longer now tidings believe if such arrive nor he d i more the song of sooth-sayers whom my mother may consult but this my guest hath known in other days my father and he came from taphos son 530 of brave anchialus mentes by name and chief of the sea-practis d taphian race so spake telemachus but in his heart knew well his guest a goddess from the skies then they to dance and heart-enlivening song turn d joyous waiting the approach of eve and dusky evening found them joyous still then each to his own house retiring sought needful repose meantime telemachus to his own lofty chamber built in view 540 of the wide hall retired but with a heart in various musings occupied intense sage euryclea bearing in each hand a torch preceded him her sire was ops pisenor s son and in her early prime at his own cost laertes made her his paying with twenty beeves her purchase-price nor in less honour than his spotless wife he held her ever but his consort s wrath fearing at no time call d her to his bed 550 she bore the torches and with truer heart loved him than any of the female train for she had nurs d him in his infant years he open d his broad chamber-valves and sat on his couch-side then putting off his vest of softest texture placed it in the hands of the attendant dame discrete who first folding it with exactest care beside his bed suspended it and going forth drew by its silver ring the portal close 560 and fasten d it with bolt and brace secure there lay telemachus on finest wool reposed contemplating all night his course prescribed by pallas to the pylian shore   aurora rosy daughter of the dawn now ting d the east when habited again uprose ulysses  offspring from his bed athwart his back his faulchion keen he flung his sandals bound to his unsullied feet and godlike issued from his chamber-door at once the clear-voic d heralds he enjoin d to call the greeks to council they aloud gave forth the summons and the throng began when all were gather d and the assembly full 10 himself his hand arm d with a brazen spear went also nor alone he went his hounds fleet-footed follow d him a faithful pair o er all his form minerva largely shed majestic grace divine and as he went the whole admiring concourse gaz d on him the seniors gave him place and down he sat on his paternal throne then grave arose the hero old ægyptius bow d with age was he and by experience deep-inform d 20 his son had with ulysses godlike chief on board his fleet to steed-fam d ilium gone the warrior antiphus whom in his cave the savage cyclops slew and on his flesh at ev ning made obscene his last regale three sons he had beside a suitor one eurynomus the other two employ  found constant managing their sire s concerns yet he forgat not father as he was of these his absent eldest whom he mourn d 30 ceaseless and thus his speech weeping began hear me ye men of ithaca my friends nor council here nor session hath been held since great ulysses left his native shore who now convenes us what especial need hath urged him whether of our youth he be or of our senators by age matured have tidings reach d him of our host s return which here he would divulge or brings he aught of public import on a diff rent theme 40 i deem him whosoe er he be a man worthy to prosper and may jove vouchsafe the full performance of his chief desire he ended and telemachus rejoiced in that good omen ardent to begin he sat not long but moving to the midst received the sceptre from pisenor s hand his prudent herald and addressing next the hoary chief ægyptius thus began not far remote as thou shalt soon thyself 50 perceive oh venerable chief he stands who hath convened this council i am he i am in chief the suff rer tidings none of the returning host i have received which here i would divulge nor bring i aught of public import on a different theme but my own trouble on my own house fall n and two-fold fall n one is that i have lost a noble father who as fathers rule benign their children govern d once yourselves 60 the other and the more alarming ill with ruin threatens my whole house and all my patrimony with immediate waste suitors their children who in this our isle hold highest rank importunate besiege my mother though desirous not to wed and rather than resort to her own sire icarius who might give his daughter dow r and portion her to whom he most approves a course which only named moves their disgust 70  they chuse assembling all within my gates daily to make my beeves my sheep my goats their banquet and to drink without restraint my wine whence ruin threatens us and ours for i have no ulysses to relieve me and my family from this abuse ourselves are not sufficient we alas too feeble should be found and yet to learn how best to use the little force we own else had i pow r i would myself redress 80 the evil for it now surpasses far all suff rance now they ravage uncontroul d nor show of decency vouchsafe me more oh be ashamed6 yourselves blush at the thought of such reproach as ye shall sure incur from all our neighbour states and fear beside the wrath of the immortals lest they call yourselves one day to a severe account i pray you by olympian jove by her whose voice convenes all councils and again 90 dissolves them themis that henceforth ye cease that ye permit me oh my friends to wear my days in solitary grief away unless ulysses my illustrious sire hath in his anger any greecian wrong d whose wrongs ye purpose to avenge on me inciting these to plague me better far were my condition if yourselves consumed my substance and my revenue from you i might obtain perchance righteous amends 100 hereafter you i might with vehement suit o ercome from house to house pleading aloud for recompense till i at last prevail d but now with darts of anguish ye transfix my inmost soul and i have no redress he spake impassion d and to earth cast down his sceptre weeping pity at that sight seiz d all the people mute the assembly sat long time none dared to greet telemachus with answer rough till of them all at last 110  antinoüs sole arising thus replied telemachus intemp rate in harangue high-sounding orator it is thy drift to make us all odious but the offence lies not with us the suitors she alone thy mother who in subtlety excels and deep-wrought subterfuge deserves the blame it is already the third year and soon shall be the fourth since with delusive art practising on their minds she hath deceived 120 the greecians message after message sent brings hope to each by turns and promise fair but she meantime far otherwise intends her other arts exhausted all she framed this stratagem a web of amplest size and subtlest woof beginning thus she spake princes my suitors since the noble chief ulysses is no more press not as yet my nuptials wait till i shall finish first a fun ral robe lest all my threads decay 130 which for the antient hero i prepare laertes looking for the mournful hour when fate shall snatch him to eternal rest else i the censure dread of all my sex should he so wealthy want at last a shroud so spake the queen and unsuspicious we with her request complied thenceforth all day she wove the ample web and by the aid of torches ravell d it again at night three years by such contrivance she deceived 140 the greecians but when three whole years elaps d the fourth arriv d then conscious of the fraud a damsel of her train told all the truth and her we found rav ling the beauteous work thus through necessity she hath at length perform d the task and in her own despight now therefore for the information clear of thee thyself and of the other greeks we answer send thy mother hence with charge that him she wed on whom her father s choice 150 shall fall and whom she shall herself approve but if by long procrastination still she persevere wearing our patience out  attentive only to display the gifts by pallas so profusely dealt to her works of surpassing skill ingenious thought and subtle shifts such as no beauteous greek for aught that we have heard in antient times e er practised tyro or alcemena fair or fair mycene of whom none in art 160 e er match d penelope although we yield to this her last invention little praise then know that these her suitors will consume so long thy patrimony and thy goods as she her present purpose shall indulge with which the gods inspire her great renown she to herself insures but equal woe and devastation of thy wealth to thee for neither to our proper works at home go we of that be sure nor yet elsewhere 170 till him she wed to whom she most inclines him prudent then answer d telemachus antinoüs it is not possible that i should thrust her forth against her will who both produced and reared me be he dead or still alive my sire is far remote and should i voluntary hence dismiss my mother to icarius i must much refund which hardship were and loss to me so doing i should also wrath incur 180 from my offended sire and from the gods still more for she departing would invoke erynnis to avenge her and reproach beside would follow me from all mankind that word i therefore never will pronounce no if ye judge your treatment at her hands injurious to you go ye forth yourselves forsake my mansion seek where else ye may your feasts consume your own alternate feed each at the other s cost but if it seem 190 wisest in your account and best to eat voracious thus the patrimonial goods of one man rend ring no account of all bite to the roots but know that i will cry ceaseless to the eternal gods in hope that jove in retribution of the wrong  shall doom you where ye have intruded there to bleed and of your blood ask no account so spake telemachus and while he spake the thund rer from a lofty mountain-top 200 turn d off two eagles on the winds awhile with outspread pinions ample side by side they floated but ere long hov ring aloft right o er the midst of the assembled chiefs they wheel d around clang d all their num rous plumes and with a downward look eyeing the throng death boded ominous then rending each the other s face and neck they sprang at once toward the right and darted through the town amazement universal at that sight 210 seized the assembly and with anxious thought each scann d the future amidst whom arose the hero halitherses antient seer offspring of mastor for in judgment he of portents augural and in forecast unerring his coevals all excell d and prudent thus the multitude bespake ye men of ithaca give ear hear all though chief my speech shall to the suitors look for on their heads devolved comes down the woe 220 ulysses shall not from his friends henceforth live absent long but hasting to his home comes even now and as he comes designs a bloody death for these whose bitter woes no few shall share inhabitants with us of pleasant ithaca but let us frame effectual means maturely to suppress their violent deeds or rather let themselves repentant cease and soonest shall be best not inexpert but well-inform d i speak 230 the future and the accomplishment announce of all which when ulysses with the greeks embark d for troy i to himself foretold i said that after many woes and loss of all his people in the twentieth year unknown to all he should regain his home and my prediction shall be now fulfill d him then eurymachus thus answer d rough the son of polybus hence to thy house  thou hoary dotard there prophetic teach 240 thy children to escape woes else to come birds num rous flutter in the beams of day not all predictive death far hence remote hath found ulysses and i would to heav n that where he died thyself had perish d too thou hadst not then run o er with prophecy as now nor provocation to the wrath giv n of telemachus in hope to win perchance for thine some favour at his hands but i to thee foretell skilled as thou art 250 in legends old nor shall my threat be vain that if by artifice thou move to wrath a younger than thyself no matter whom woe first the heavier on himself shall fall nor shalt thou profit him by thy attempt and we will charge thee also with a mulct which thou shalt pay with difficulty and bear the burthen of it with an aching heart as for telemachus i him advise myself and press the measure on his choice 260 earnestly that he send his mother hence to her own father s house who shall himself set forth her nuptial rites and shall endow his daughter sumptuously and as he ought for this expensive wooing as i judge till then shall never cease since we regard no man no not telemachus although in words exub rant neither fear we aught thy vain prognostics venerable sir but only hate thee for their sake the more 270 waste will continue and disorder foul unremedied so long as she shall hold the suitors in suspense for day by day our emulation goads us to the strife nor shall we going hence seek to espouse each his own comfort suitable elsewhere to whom discrete telemachus replied eurymachus and ye the suitor train illustrious i have spoken ye shall hear no more this supplication urged by me 280 the gods and all the greeks now know the truth but give me instantly a gallant bark  with twenty rowers skill d their course to win to whatsoever haven for i go to sandy pylus and shall hasten thence to lacedemon tidings to obtain of my long-absent sire or from the lips of man or by a word from jove vouchsafed himself best source of notice to mankind if there inform d that still my father lives 290 i hope conceive of his return although distress d i shall be patient yet a year but should i learn haply that he survives no longer then returning i will raise at home his

embarking thence he had consign d 300 all his concerns that the old chief might rule his family and keep the whole secure arising thus the senior sage began hear me ye ithacans be never king henceforth benevolent gracious humane or righteous but let every sceptred hand rule merciless and deal in wrong alone since none of all his people whom he sway d with such paternal gentleness and love remembers the divine ulysses more 310 that the imperious suitors thus should weave the web of mischief and atrocious wrong i grudge not since at hazard of their heads they make ulysses  property a prey persuaded that the hero comes no more but much the people move me how ye sit all mute and though a multitude yourselves opposed to few risque not a single word to check the license of these bold intruders then thus liocritus evenor s son 320 injurious mentor headlong orator how dar st thou move the populace against the suitors trust me they should find it hard numerous as they are to cope with us a feast the prize or should the king himself  of ithaca returning undertake t  expell the jovial suitors from his house much as penelope his absence mourns his presence should afford her little joy for fighting sole with many he should meet 330 a dreadful death thou therefore speak st amiss as for telemachus let mentor him and halytherses furnish forth the friends long valued of his sire with all dispatch though him i judge far likelier to remain long-time contented an enquirer here than to perform the voyage now proposed thus saying liocritus dissolved in haste the council and the scattered concourse sought their sev ral homes while all the suitors flock d 340 thence to the palace of their absent king meantime telemachus from all resort retiring in the surf of the gray deep first laved his hands then thus to pallas pray d o goddess who wast yesterday a guest beneath my roof and didst enjoin me then a voyage o er the sable deep in quest of tidings of my long regretted sire which voyage all in ithaca but most the haughty suitors obstinate impede 350 now hear my suit and gracious interpose such pray r he made then pallas in the form and with the voice of mentor drawing nigh in accents wing d him kindly thus bespake telemachus thou shalt hereafter prove nor base nor poor in talents if in truth thou have received from heav n thy father s force instill d into thee and resemblest him in promptness both of action and of speech thy voyage shall not useless be or vain 360 but if penelope produced thee not his son i then hope not for good effect of this design which ardent thou pursuest few sons their fathers equal most appear degenerate but we find though rare sometimes a son superior even to his sire and since thyself shalt neither base be found nor spiritless nor altogether void  of talents such as grace thy royal sire i therefore hope success of thy attempt 370 heed not the suitors  projects neither wise are they nor just nor aught suspect the doom which now approaches them and in one day shall overwhelm them all no long suspense shall hold thy purposed enterprise in doubt such help from me of old thy father s friend thou shalt receive who with a bark well-oar d will serve thee and myself attend thee forth but haste join thou the suitors and provide in sep rate vessels stow d all needful stores 380 wine in thy jars and flour the strength of man in skins close-seam d i will meantime select such as shall voluntary share thy toils in sea-girt ithaca new ships and old abound and i will chuse myself for thee the prime of all which without more delay we will launch out into the spacious deep thus pallas spake daughter of jove nor long so greeted by the voice divine remain d telemachus but to his palace went 390 distress d in heart he found the suitors there goats slaying in the hall and fatted swine roasting when with a laugh antinoüs flew to meet him fasten d on his hand and said telemachus in eloquence sublime and of a spirit not to be controul d give harbour in thy breast on no account to after-grudge or enmity but eat far rather cheerfully as heretofore and freely drink committing all thy cares 400 to the achaians who shall furnish forth a gallant ship and chosen crew for thee that thou may st hence to pylus with all speed tidings to learn of thy illustrious sire to whom telemachus discrete replied antinoüs i have no heart to feast with guests so insolent nor can indulge the pleasures of a mind at ease with you is t not enough suitors that ye have used my noble patrimony as your own 410 while i was yet a child now grown mature  and competent to understand the speech of my instructors feeling too a mind within me conscious of augmented pow rs i will attempt your ruin be assured whether at pylus or continuing here i go indeed nor shall my voyage prove of which i speak bootless or vain i go an humble passenger who neither bark nor rowers have to boast my own denied 420 that honour so ye judg d it

wantoning of whom a youth arrogant as his fellows thus began i see it plain telemachus intends our slaughter either he will aids procure from sandy pylus or will bring them arm d 430 from sparta such is his tremendous drift even to fruitful ephyre perchance he will proceed seeking some baneful herb which cast into our cup shall drug us all to whom some haughty suitor thus replied who knows but that himself wand ring the sea from all his friends and kindred far remote may perish like ulysses whence to us should double toil ensue on whom the charge to parcel out his wealth would then devolve 440 and to endow his mother with the house for his abode whom she should chance to wed so sported they but he ascending sought his father s lofty chamber where his heaps he kept of brass and gold

the stores already sorted and set forth but nought my mother knows or any of her train of this design one matron sole except he spake and led them they obedient brought 530 all down and as ulysses

hawsers and embarking fill d the benches blue-eyed pallas from the west call d forth propitious breezes fresh they curled the sable deep and sounding swept the waves he loud-exhorting them his people bade 540  hand brisk the tackle they obedient reared the pine-tree mast which in its socket deep they lodg d then strain d the cordage and with thongs well-twisted drew the shining sail aloft a

entreat himself that he will tell thee only truth who will not lye for he is passing wise to whom telemachus discrete replied ah mentor how can i advance how greet  a chief like him unpractis d as i

with more seemliness we may enquire after repast what guests we have received our guests who are ye whence have ye the waves plough d hither come ye to transact concerns 90 commercial or at random roam the deep like pirates who with mischief charged and woe to foreign states oft hazard life themselves him answer d bolder now but still discrete telemachus for pallas had his heart with manly courage arm d that he might ask from nestor tidings of his absent sire and win himself distinction and renown oh nestor neleus  son glory of greece thou askest whence we are i tell thee whence 100 from ithaca by the umbrageous woods of neritus o erhung by private need not public urged we come my errand is to seek intelligence of the renown d ulysses of my noble father prais d for dauntless

by performance just of word or deed at ilium where ye fell so num rous slain in fight oh recollect now his fidelity and tell me true then nestor thus gerenian hero old young friend since thou remind st me speaking thus 130 of all the woes which indefatigable we sons of the achaians there sustain d both those which wand ring on the deep we bore wherever by achilles led in quest of booty and the many woes beside which under royal priam s spacious walls we suffer d know that there our bravest fell there warlike ajax lies there peleus  son there too patroclus like the gods themselves in council

indeed art his as sure thou art whose sight breeds wonder in me and thy speech his speech resembles more than might be deem d within the scope of years so green as thine  there never in opinion or in

barks and when the gods had scatter d them then jove imagin d for the argive host a sorrowful return for neither just were all nor prudent therefore many found a fate disast rous through the vengeful ire of jove-born pallas who between the sons of atreus sharp contention interposed 170 they both irregularly and against just order summoning by night the greeks to council of whom many came with wine oppress d promulgated the cause for which they had convened the people then it was that menelaus bade the general host their thoughts bend homeward o er the sacred deep which agamemnon in no sort approved his counsel was to slay them yet at troy that so he might assuage the dreadful wrath 180 of pallas first by sacrifice and pray r vain hope he little thought how ill should speed that fond attempt for once provok d the gods are not with ease conciliated again thus stood the brothers altercation hot maintaining till at length uprose the greeks with deaf ning clamours and with diff ring minds we slept the night but teeming with disgust mutual for jove great woe prepar d for all at dawn of day we drew our gallies down 190 into the sea and hasty put on board the spoils and female captives half the host with agamemnon son of atreus stay d supreme commander and embarking half push d forth swift course we made for neptune smooth d the waves before us of the monstrous deep at tenedos arriv d we there perform d sacrifice to the gods ardent to reach our native land but unpropitious jove not yet designing our arrival there 200  involved us in dissension fierce again for all the crews followers of the king thy noble sire to gratify our chief the son of atreus chose a diff rent course and steer d their oary barks again to troy but i assured that evil from the gods impended gath ring all my gallant fleet fled thence in haste and warlike diomede exhorting his attendants also fled at length the hero menelaus join d 210 our fleets at lesbos there he found us held in deep deliberation on the length of way before us whether we should steer above the craggy chios to the isle psyria that island holding on our left or under chios by the wind-swept heights of mimas then we ask d from jove a sign and by a sign vouchsafed he bade us cut the wide sea to eubœa sheer athwart so soonest to escape the threat ned harm 220 shrill sang the rising gale and with swift prows cleaving the fishy flood we reach d by night geræstus where arrived we burn d the thighs of num rous bulls to neptune who had safe conducted us through all our perilous course the fleet of diomede in safety moor d on the fourth day at argos but myself held on my course to pylus nor the wind one moment thwarted us or died away when jove had once commanded it to blow 230 thus uninform d i have

spear-famed myrmidons as rumour speaks by neoptolemus illustrious son of brave achilles led have safe arrived safe philoctetes also son renown d of pæas and idomeneus at crete 240 hath landed all his followers who survive the bloody war the waves have swallow d none ye have yourselves doubtless although remote  of agamemnon heard how he return d and how ægisthus cruelly contrived for him a bloody welcome but himself hath with his own life paid the murth rous deed good is it therefore if a son survive the slain since agamemnon s son hath well avenged his father s death slaying himself 250 ægisthus foul assassin of his sire young friend for pleas d thy vig rous youth i view and just proportion be thou also bold that thine like his may be a deathless name then prudent him answer d telemachus oh nestor neleus  son glory of greece and righteous was that vengeance his renown achaia s sons shall far and wide diffuse to future times transmitting it in song ah would that such ability the gods 260 would grant to me that i as well the deeds might punish of our suitors whose excess enormous and whose bitter taunts i feel continual object of their subtle hate but not for me such happiness the gods have twined into my thread no not for me or for my father patience is our part to whom gerenian nestor thus replied young friend since thou remind st me of that theme fame here reports that num rous suitors haunt 270 thy palace for thy mother s sake and there much evil perpetrate in thy despight but say endur st thou willing their controul imperious or because the people sway d by some response oracular incline against thee but who knows the time may come when to his home restored either alone or aided by the force of all the greeks ulysses may avenge the wrong at least should pallas azure-eyed thee love as erst 280 at troy the scene of our unnumber d woes she lov d ulysses for i have not known the gods assisting so apparently a mortal man as him minerva there should pallas view thee also with like love and kind solicitude some few of those  should dream perchance of wedlock never more then answer thus telemachus return d that word s accomplishment i cannot hope it promises too much the thought alone 290 o erwhelms me an event so fortunate would unexpected on my part arrive although the gods themselves should purpose it but pallas him answer d cærulean-eyed telemachus what word was that which leap d the iv ry guard7 that should have fenced it in a god so willing could with utmost ease save any man howe er remote myself i had much rather many woes endured revisit home at last happy and safe 300 than sooner coming die in my own house as agamemnon perish d by the arts of base ægisthus and the subtle queen yet not the gods themselves can save from death all-levelling the man whom most they love when fate ordains him once to his last sleep to whom telemachus discrete replied howe er it interest us let us leave this question mentor he i am assured returns no more but hath already found 310 a sad sad fate by the decree of heav n but i would now interrogate again nestor and on a different theme for him in human rights i judge and laws expert and in all knowledge beyond other men for he hath govern d as report proclaims three generations therefore in my eyes he wears the awful impress of a god oh nestor son of neleus tell me true what was the manner of atrides  death 320 wide-ruling agamemnon tell me where was menelaus by what means contrived ægisthus to inflict the fatal blow slaying so much a nobler than himself had not the brother of the monarch reach d  achaian argos yet but wand ring still in other climes his long absence gave ægisthus courage for that bloody deed whom answer d the gerenian chief renown d my son i will inform thee true meantime 330 thy own suspicions border on the fact had menelaus hero amber hair d ægisthus found living at his return from ilium never on his bones the greeks had heap d a tomb but dogs and rav ning fowls had torn him lying in the open field far from the town nor him had woman wept of all in greece for he had foul transgress d but we in many an arduous task engaged lay before ilium he the while secure 340 within the green retreats of argos found occasion apt by flatt ry to delude the spouse of agamemnon she at first the royal clytemnestra firm refused the deed dishonourable for she bore a virtuous mind and at her side a bard attended ever whom the king to troy departing had appointed to the charge but when the gods had purposed to ensnare ægisthus then dismissing far remote 350 the bard into a desart isle he there abandon d him to rav ning fowls a prey and to his own home willing as himself led clytemnestra num rous thighs he burn d on all their

waves sent him mountainous his ships there scatter d some to the cydonian coast of crete he push d near where the jardan flows beside the confines of gortyna stands amid the gloomy flood a smooth rock steep toward the sea against whose leftward point phæstus by name the south wind rolls the surge 380 amain which yet the rock though small repells hither with part he came and scarce the crews

young friend from thy forsaken home rove not long time remote thy treasures left at mercy of those proud lest they divide and waste the whole rend ring thy voyage vain but hence to menelaus is the course to which i counsel thee for he hath come of late from distant lands whence to escape no man could hope whom tempests first had driv n devious into so wide a sea from which 410 themselves the

thy guides to noble lacedemon the abode of menelaus ask from him the truth who will not lye for he is passing wise while thus he spake the sun declined and night approaching blue-eyed pallas interposed 420 o antient king well hast thou spoken all but now delay not cut ye forth the tongues8 and mingle wine that neptune first invoked with due libation and the other gods we may repair to

telemachus with whom they have embark d for friendship s sake alone 460 i therefore will repose myself on board this night and to the caucons bold in arms will sail to-morrow to demand arrears long time unpaid and of no small amount but since he is become thy guest afford my friend a chariot and a son of thine who shall direct his way nor let him want of all thy steeds the swiftest and the best so saying the blue-eyed goddess as upborne on eagle s wings vanish d amazement seized 470 the whole assembly and the antient king o erwhelmed with wonder at that sight the hand grasp d of telemachus

there they brought their journey to a close so rapidly they moved and now the sun went down and even-tide dimm d all the ways   when words like these in vocal breath burst from his twofold hedge of teeth   in hollow lacedæmon s spacious vale arriving to the house they drove direct of royal menelaus him they found in his own palace all his num rous friends regaling at a nuptial banquet giv n both for his daughter and the prince his son his daughter to renown d achilles  heir he sent to whom he had at troy engaged to give her and the gods now made her his with chariots and with steeds he sent her forth 10 to the illustrious city where the prince achilles  offspring ruled the myrmidons but to his son he gave a spartan fair alector s daughter from an handmaid sprang that son to menelaus in his age brave megapenthes for the gods no child to helen gave made mother once of her who vied in perfect loveliness of form with golden venus  self hermione thus all the neighbour princes and the friends 20 of noble menelaus feasting sat within his spacious palace among whom a sacred bard sang sweetly to his harp while in the midst two dancers smote the ground with measur d steps responsive to his song and now the heroes nestor s noble son and young telemachus arrived within the vestibule whom issuing from the hall  the noble eteoneus of the train of menelaus saw at once he ran 30 across the palace to report the news to his lord s ear and standing at his side in accents wing d with haste thus greeted him oh menelaus heav n descended chief two guests arrive both strangers but the race of jove supreme resembling each in form say shall we loose ourselves their rapid steeds or hence dismiss them to some other host but menelaus hero golden-hair d indignant answer d him boethe s son 40 thou wast not eteoneus heretofore a babbler who now pratest as a child we have ourselves arrived indebted much to hospitality of other men if jove shall even here some pause at last of woe afford us therefore loose at once their steeds and introduce them to the feast he said and issuing eteoneus call d the brisk attendants to his aid with whom he loos d their foaming coursers from the yoke 50 them first they bound to mangers which with oats and mingled barley they supplied then thrust the chariot sidelong to the splendid wall9 themselves he next into the royal house conducted who survey d wond ring the abode of the heav n-favour d king for on all sides as with the splendour of the sun or moon the lofty dome of menelaus blazed satiate at length with wonder at that sight they enter d each a bath and by the hands 60 of maidens laved and oil d and cloath d again with shaggy mantles and resplendent vests sat both enthroned at menelaus  side and now a maiden charged with golden ew r and with an argent laver pouring first pure water on their hands supplied them next with a bright table which the maiden chief in office furnish d plenteously with bread and dainties remnants of the last regale  then came the sew r who with delicious meats 70 dish after dish served them and placed beside the chargers cups magnificent of gold when menelaus grasp d their hands and said eat and rejoice and when ye shall have shared our nuptial banquet we will then inquire who are ye both for certain not from those whose generation perishes are ye but rather of some race of sceptred chiefs heav n-born the base have never sons like you so saying he from the board lifted his own 80 distinguish d portion and the fatted chine gave to his guests the sav ry viands they with outstretch d hands assail d and when the force no longer now of appetite they felt telemachus inclining close his head to nestor s son lest others should his speech witness in whisper d words him thus address d dearest pisistratus observe my friend how all the echoing palace with the light of beaming brass of gold and amber shines 90 silver and ivory for radiance such th  interior mansion of olympian jove i deem what wealth how various how immense is here astonish d i survey the sight but menelaus golden-hair d his speech o erhearing thus in accents wing d replied my children let no mortal man pretend comparison with jove for jove s abode and all his stores are incorruptible but whether mortal man with me may vie 100 in the display of wealth or whether not this know that after many toils endured and perilous wand rings wide in the eighth year i brought my treasures home remote i roved to cyprus to phœnice to the shores of ægypt æthiopia s land i reach d th  erembi the sidonians and the coasts

of flesh or of sweet milk  delicious drawn from udders never dry while thus commodities on various coasts gath ring i roam d another by the arts of his pernicious spouse aided of life bereav d my

that the greeks who perish d then beneath the walls of troy far from steed-pastured argos still survived yet while sequester d here i frequent mourn my slaughter d friends by turns i sooth my soul 130 with tears shed for them and by turns again i cease for grief soon satiates free indulged but of them all although i all bewail none mourn i so as one whom calling back to memory i both sleep and food abhor for of achaia s sons none ever toiled strenuous as ulysses but his lot was woe and unremitting sorrow mine for his long absence who if still he live we know not aught or be already dead 140 him doubtless old laertes mourns and him discrete penelope nor less his son telemachus born newly when he sail d so saying he kindled in him strong desire to mourn his father at his father s name fast fell his tears to ground and with both hands he spread his purple cloak before his eyes which menelaus marking doubtful sat if he should leave him leisure for his tears or question him and tell him all at large 150 while thus he doubted helen as it chanced leaving her fragrant chamber came august as dian goddess of the golden bow adrasta for her use set forth a throne alcippe with soft arras cover d it  and philo brought her silver basket gift of fair alcandra wife of polybus whose mansion in ægyptian thebes is rich in untold treasure and who gave himself ten golden talents and two silver baths 160 to menelaus with two splendid tripods beside the noble gifts which at the hand of his illustrious spouse helen receiv d a golden spindle and a basket wheel d itself of silver and its lip of gold that basket philo her own handmaid placed at beauteous helen s side charged to the brim with slender threads on which the spindle lay with wool of purple lustre wrapp d around approaching on her foot-stool d throne she sat 170 and instant of her royal spouse enquired know we my menelaus dear to jove these guests of ours and whence they have arrived erroneous i may speak yet speak i must in man or woman never have i seen such likeness to another wonder-fixt i gaze as in this stranger to the son of brave ulysses whom that hero left new-born at home when shameless as i was for my unworthy sake the greecians sailed 180 to ilium with fierce rage of battle fir d then menelaus thus the golden-hair d i also such resemblance find in him as thou such feet such hands the cast of eye10 similar and the head and flowing locks and even now when i ulysses named and his great sufferings mention d in my cause the bitter tear dropp d from his lids while broad before his eyes his purple cloak he spread to whom the son of nestor thus replied 190 atrides menelaus chief renown d he is in truth his son as thou hast said but he is modest and would much himself condemn if at his first arrival here he should loquacious seem and bold to thee to whom we listen captived by thy voice as if some god had spoken as for me  nestor my father the gerenian chief bade me conduct him hither for he wish d to see thee promising himself from thee 200 the benefit of some kind word or deed for destitute of other aid he much his father s tedious absence mourns at home so fares telemachus his father strays remote and in his stead no friend hath he who might avert the mischiefs that he feels to whom the hero amber-hair d replied ye gods the offspring of indeed a friend hath reach d my house of one who hath endured arduous conflicts num rous for my sake 210 and much i purpos d had olympian jove vouchsaf d us prosp rous passage o er the deep to have receiv d him with such friendship here as none beside in argos i had then founded a city for him and had rais d a palace for himself i would have brought the hero hither and his son with all his people and with all his wealth some town evacuating for his sake of those ruled by myself and neighb ring close my own 220 thus situate we had often interchanged sweet converse nor had other cause at last our friendship terminated or our joys than death s black cloud o ershadowing him or me but such delights could only envy move ev n in the gods who have of all the greeks amerc d him only of his wish d return so saying he kindled the desire to weep in ev ry bosom argive helen wept abundant jove s own daughter wept as fast 230 telemachus and menelaus both nor nestor s son with tearless eyes remain d calling to mind antilochus11 by the son12 illustrious of the bright aurora slain rememb ring whom in accents wing d he said atrides antient nestor when of late conversing with him we remember d thee pronounced thee wise beyond all human-kind  now therefore let not even my advice displease thee it affords me no delight 240 to intermingle tears with my repast and soon aurora daughter of the dawn will tinge the orient not that i account due lamentation of a friend deceased blameworthy since to sheer the locks and weep is all we can for the unhappy dead i also have my grief call d to lament one not the meanest of achaia s sons my brother him i cannot but suppose to thee well-known although unknown to me 250 who saw him never13 but report proclaims antilochus superior to the most in speed superior and in feats of arms to whom the hero of the yellow locks o friend belov d since nought which thou hast said or recommended now would have disgraced a man of years maturer far than thine for wise thy father is and such art thou and easy is it to discern the son of such a father whom saturnian jove 260 in marriage both and at his birth ordain d to great felicity for he hath giv n to nestor gradually to sink at home into old age and while he lives to see his sons past others wise and skill d in arms the sorrow into which we sudden fell shall pause come now remember we the feast pour water on our hands for we shall find telemachus and i no dearth of themes for mutual converse when the day shall dawn 270 he ended then asphalion at his word servant of glorious menelaus poured pure water on their hands and they the feast before them with keen appetite assail d but jove-born helen otherwise meantime employ d into the wine of which they drank a drug infused antidote to the pains of grief and anger a most potent charm for ills of ev ry name whoe er his wine so medicated drinks he shall not pour 280  all day the tears down his wan cheek although his father and his mother both were dead nor even though his brother or his son

things obey now therefore feasting at your ease reclin d listen with pleasure for myself the while 300 will matter seasonable interpose i cannot all rehearse nor even name omitting none the conflicts and exploits of brave ulysses but with what address successful one atchievement he perform d at ilium where achaia s sons endured such hardship will i speak inflicting wounds dishonourable on himself he took a tatter d garb and like a serving-man enter d the spacious city of your foes 310 so veil d some mendicant he seem d although no greecian less deserved that name than he in such disguise he enter d all alike misdeem d him me alone he not deceived who challeng d him but shrewd he turn d away at length however when i had myself bathed him anointed cloath d him and had sworn not to declare him openly in troy till he should reach again the camp and fleet he told me the whole purpose of the greeks 320 then many a trojan slaughter d he regain d the camp and much intelligence he bore to the achaians oh what wailing then  was heard of trojan women but my heart exulted alter d now and wishing home for now my crime committed under force of venus  influence i deplored what time she led me to a country far remote a wand rer from the matrimonial bed from my own child and from my rightful lord 330 alike unblemish d both in form and mind her answer d then the hero golden-hair d helen thou hast well spoken all is true i have the talents fathom d and the minds of num rous heroes and have travell d far yet never saw i with these eyes in man such firmness as the calm ulysses own d none such as in the wooden horse he proved where all our bravest sat designing woe and bloody havoc for the sons of troy 340 thou thither cam st impell d as it should seem by some divinity inclin d to give victory to our foes and with thee came godlike deiphobus thrice round about the hollow ambush striking with thy hand its sides thou went st and by his name didst call each prince of greece feigning

with both hands compressing close his lips saved us nor ceased till pallas thence conducted thee again then thus discrete telemachus replied 360 atrides menelaus prince renown d hard was his lot whom these rare qualities preserved not neither had his dauntless heart been iron had he scaped his cruel doom but haste dismiss us hence that on our beds reposed we may enjoy sleep needful now  he ceas d then argive helen gave command to her attendant maidens to prepare beds in the portico with purple rugs resplendent and with arras overspread 370 and cover d warm with cloaks of shaggy pile forth went the maidens bearing each a torch and spread the couches next the herald them led forth and in the vestibule the son of nestor and the youthful hero slept telemachus but in the interior house atrides with the loveliest of her sex beside him helen of the sweeping stole but when aurora daughter of the dawn glow d in the east then from his couch arose 380 the warlike menelaus fresh attir d his faulchion o er his shoulders slung he bound his sandals fair to his unsullied feet and like a god issuing at the side sat of telemachus to whom he spake hero telemachus what urgent cause hath hither led thee to the land far-famed of lacedæmon o er the spacious deep public concern or private tell me true to whom telemachus discrete replied 390 atrides menelaus prince renown d news seeking of my

replied gods their ambition is to reach the bed of a brave man however base themselves but as it chances when the hart hath lay d her fawns new-yean d and sucklings yet to rest within some dreadful lion s gloomy den she roams the hills and in the grassy vales feeds heedless till the lion to his lair return d destroys her and her little-ones so them thy sire shall terribly destroy 420 jove pallas

bitter nuptials should be theirs but thy enquiries neither indirect will i evade nor give thee false reply but all that from the antient of the deep14 i have receiv d will utter hiding nought 430 as yet the gods on ægypt s shore detained me wishing home angry at my neglect to heap their altars with slain hecatombs for they exacted from us evermore strict rev rence of their laws there is an isle amid the billowy flood pharos by name in front of ægypt distant from her shore far as a vessel by a sprightly gale impell d may push her voyage in a day the haven there is good and many a ship 440 finds wat ring there from riv lets on the coast there me the gods kept twenty days no breeze propitious granting that might sweep the waves and usher to her home the flying bark and now had our provision all consumed left us exhausted but a certain nymph pitying saved me daughter fair was she of mighty proteus antient of the deep idothea named her most my sorrows moved she found me from my followers all apart 450 wand ring for they around the isle with hooks  the fishes snaring roamed by famine urged and standing at my side me thus bespake stranger thou must be ideot born or weak at

rising brought us thence four skins of phocæ and all newly stript a snare contriving subtle to deceive her sire four cradles in the sand she scoop d then sat expecting us who in due time approach d

ægisthus easy lay his course and open thence and as it pleased the gods the shifted wind soon bore them to their home he high in exultation trod the shore that gave him birth kiss d it and at the

replied awful divinity be not incensed i know that my penelope in form and stature altogether yields to thee for she is mortal and immortal thou 260 from age exempt yet not the less i wish my home and languish daily to return but should some god amid the sable deep dash me again into a wreck my soul shall bear that also for by practice taught i have learned patience having much endured by tempest

neptune now returning from the land of ethiopia mark d him on his raft skimming the billows from the mountain-tops 340 of distant solyma21 with tenfold wrath inflamed that sight he view d his brows he

impetuous whirl d the raft around and dashing from his grasp the helm himself plunged far remote then came a sudden gust of mingling winds that in the middle snapp d his mast and hurried o er the

coast in search of sloping beach haven or shelter d creek i fear lest groaning i be snatch d again by stormy gusts into the fishy deep or lest some monster of the flood receive command to seize me of the many such by the illustrious amphitrite bred for that the mighty shaker of the shores hates me implacable too well i know while such discourse within himself he held 510 a huge wave heav d him on

extracted from his stony bed adhere so he the rough rocks clasping stripp d his hands raw and the billows now whelm d him again then had the hapless hero premature perish d but for sagacity inspired by pallas azure-eyed forth from the waves emerging where the surf burst on the rocks he coasted looking landward as he swam the shore with hope of port or level beach but when still swimming to the mouth he came 530 of a smooth-sliding river there he deem d safest th  ascent for it was undeform d by rocks and shelter d close from ev ry wind he felt the current and thus ardent pray d o hear whate

loosing from beneath his breast the zone divine he cast it far into the brackish stream and a huge wave returning bore it downward to the sea where ino caught it then the river s brink abandoning

demodocus his lyre clear-toned left somewhere in our hall at home 310 so spake the godlike king at whose command the herald to the palace quick return d to seek the charming lyre meantime arose nine arbiters appointed to intend the whole arrangement of the public games to smooth the circus floor and give the ring its compass widening the attentive throng ere long the herald came bearing the harp with which demodocus supplied advanced into the middle area around whom 320  stood blooming youths all skilful in the dance with footsteps justly timed all smote at once the sacred floor ulysses wonder-fixt the ceaseless play of twinkling30 feet admired then tuning his sweet chords demodocus a jocund strain began his theme the loves of mars and cytherea chaplet-crown d how first clandestine

encircled all his bed on ev ry side he feign d a journey thence to lemnos of all cities that adorn the earth the city that he favours most 350 nor kept the god of the resplendent reins mars drowsy watch but seeing that the famed artificer of heav n had left his home flew to the house of vulcan hot to enjoy the goddess with the wreath-encircled brows she newly from her potent sire return d the

was the theme of the illustrious bard ulysses with delight that song and all the maritime phæacian concourse heard alcinoüs then for in the dance they pass d all others call d his sons to dance alone halius and laodamas they gave the purple ball into their hands the work exact of polybus one re-supine upcast it high toward the dusky clouds the other springing into air with ease 460 received it ere

the unsullied sheath of iv ry recent from the carver s hand a gift like this he shall not need despise so saying his silver-studded sword he gave into his grasp and courteous thus began hail honour d stranger and if word of mine 500 have harm d thee rashly spoken let the winds bear all remembrance of it swift away may the gods give thee to behold again thy wife and to attain thy native shore whence absent long thou hast so much endured to whom ulysses ever-wise replied hail also thou and may the gods my friend grant thee felicity and may never want of this thy sword touch thee in time to come by whose kind phrase appeas d my wrath subsides 510 he ended and athwart his shoulders threw the weapon bright emboss d now sank the sun and those rich gifts arrived which to the house of king alcinoüs the heralds bore alcinoüs  sons receiv d them and beside their royal mother placed the precious charge the king then led the way at whose abode arrived again they press d their lofty thrones and to areta thus the monarch spake haste bring a coffer bring thy best and store 520 a mantle and a sumptuous vest within warm for him next a brazen bath by which refresh d and viewing in fair order placed the noble gifts by the phæacian lords conferr d on him he may the more enjoy  our banquet and the bard s harmonious song i give him also this my golden cup splendid elaborate that while he lives what time he pours libation forth to jove and all the gods he may remember me 530 he ended at whose words areta bade her maidens with dispatch place o er the fire a tripod ample-womb d obedient they advanced a laver to the glowing hearth water infused and kindled wood beneath the flames encircling bright the bellied vase warm d soon the flood within meantime the queen producing from her chamber-stores a chest all-elegant within it placed the gold and raiment gifts of the phæacian chiefs 540 with her own gifts the mantle and the vest and in wing d accents to ulysses said now take thyself the coffer s lid in charge girdle it quickly with a cord lest loss befall thee on thy way while thou perchance shalt sleep secure on board the sable bark which when ulysses heard hero renown d adjusting close the lid he cast a cord around it which with many a mazy knot he tied by circe taught him long before 550 and now the mistress of the household charge summon d him to his bath glad he beheld the steaming vase uncustom d to its use e er since his voyage from the isle of fair calypso although while a guest with her ever familiar with it as a god laved by attendant damsels and with oil refresh d he put his sumptuous tunic on and mantle and proceeding from the bath to the symposium join d the num rous guests 560 but as he pass d the princess all divine beside the pillars of the portal lost in admiration of his graceful form stood and in accents wing d him thus address d hail stranger at thy native home arrived remember me thy first deliv rer here to whom ulysses ever-wise replied nausicaa daughter of the noble king  alcinoüs so may jove high-thund ring mate of juno grant me to behold again 570 my native land and my delightful home as even there i will present my vows to thee adoring thee as i adore the gods themselves virgin by whom i live he said and on his throne beside the king alcinoüs sat and now they portion d out the feast to all and charg d the cups with wine and introducing by his hand the bard phæacia s glory at the column s side the herald placed demodocus again 580 then carving forth a portion from the loins of a huge brawn of which uneaten still large part and delicate remain d thus spake ulysses herald bear it to the bard for his regale whom i will soon embrace in spite of sorrow for respect is due and veneration to the sacred bard from all mankind for that the muse inspires herself his song and loves the tuneful tribe he ended and the herald bore his charge 590 to the old hero who with joy received that meed of honour at the bearer s hand then all at once assail d the ready feast and hunger now and thirst both satisfied thus to demodocus ulysses spake demodocus i give thee praise above all mortals for that either thee the muse jove s daughter teaches or the king himself apollo since thou so record st the fate with such clear method of achaia s host 600 their deeds heroic and their num rous toils as thou hadst present been thyself or learnt from others present there the glorious tale come then proceed that rare invention sing the horse of wood which by minerva s aid epeus framed and which ulysses erst convey d into the citadel of troy with warriors fill d who lay d all ilium waste these things rehearse regular and myself will instant publish in the ears of all 610 thy fame reporting thee a bard to whom  apollo free imparts celestial song he ended then apollo with full force rush d on demodocus and he began what time the greeks first firing their own camp steer d all their galleys from the shore of troy already in the horse conceal d his band around ulysses sat for ilium s sons themselves had drawn it to the citadel and there the mischief stood then strife arose 620 among the trojans compassing the horse and threefold was the doubt whether to cleave the hollow trunk asunder or updrawn aloft to cast it headlong from the rocks or to permit the enormous image kept entire to stand an off ring to the gods which was their destined course for fate had fix d their ruin sure when once they had received within their walls that engine huge in which sat all the bravest greecians with the fate 630 of ilium charged and slaughter of her sons he sang how from the horse effused the greeks left their capacious ambush and the town made desolate to others in his song he gave the praise of wasting all beside but told how fierce as mars ulysses join d with godlike menelaus to the house flew of deiphobus him there engaged in direst fight he sang and through the aid of glorious pallas conqu ror over all 640 so sang the bard illustrious at whose song ulysses melted and tear after tear fell on his cheeks as when a woman weeps her husband who hath fallen in defence of his own city and his babes before the gates she sinking folds him in her arms and gazing on him as he pants and dies shrieks at the sight meantime the enemy smiting her shoulders with the spear to toil command her and to bondage far away 650 and her cheek fades with horror at the sound ulysses so from his moist lids let fall the frequent tear unnoticed by the rest those drops but not by king alcinoüs fell  who seated at his side his heavy sighs remark d and the phæacians thus bespake phæacian chiefs and senators attend now let demodocus enjoin his harp silence for not alike grateful to all his music sounds during our feast and since 660 the bard divine began continual flow the stranger s sorrows by remembrance caused of some great woe which wraps his soul around then let the bard suspend his song that all as most befits th  occasion may rejoice both guest and hosts together since we make this voyage and these gifts confer in proof of hospitality and unfeign d love judging with all wise men the stranger-guest and suppliant worthy of a brother s place 670 and thou conceal not artfully reserv d what i shall ask far better plain declared than smother d close who art thou speak thy name the name by which thy father mother friends and fellow-citizens with all who dwell around thy native city in times past have known thee for of all things human none lives altogether nameless whether good or whether bad but ev ry man receives ev n in the moment of his birth a name 680 thy country people city tell the mark at which my ships intelligent shall aim that they may bear thee thither for our ships no pilot need or helm as ships are wont but know themselves our purpose know beside all cities and all fruitful regions well of all the earth and with dark clouds involv d plough rapid the rough deep fearless of harm whate er betide and of disast rous wreck yet thus long since my father i have heard 690 nausithoüs speaking neptune he would say is angry with us for that safe we bear strangers of ev ry nation to their home and he foretold a time when he would smite in vengeance some phæacian gallant bark returning after convoy of her charge and fix her in the sable flood transform d  into a mountain right before the town so spake my hoary sire which let the god at his own pleasure do or leave undone 700 but tell me truth and plainly where have been thy wand rings in what regions of the earth hast thou arrived what nations hast thou seen what cities say how many hast thou found harsh savage and unjust how many kind to strangers and disposed to fear the gods say also from what secret grief of heart thy sorrows flow oft as thou hear st the fate of the achaians or of ilium sung that fate the gods prepared they spin the thread 710 of man s destruction that in after days the bard may make the sad event his theme perish d thy father or thy brother there or hast thou at the siege of ilium lost father-in-law or son-in-law for such are next and dearest to us after those who share our own descent

many-twinkling feet   then answer thus ulysses wise return d alcinoüs king illustrious above all phæacia s sons pleasant it is to hear a bard like this sweet as the gods in song the world in my account no sight affords more gratifying than a people blest with cheerfulness and peace a palace throng d with guests in order ranged list ning to sounds melodious and the steaming tables spread with plenteous viands while the cups with wine 10 from brimming beakers fill d pass brisk around no lovelier sight know i but thou it seems thy thoughts hast turn d to ask me whence my groans and tears

be fair and plenteous in a foreign land but come my painful voyage such as jove gave me from ilium i will now relate from troy the winds bore me to ismarus city of the ciconians them i slew and laid their city waste whence bringing forth much spoil with all their wives i portion d it 50 with equal hand and each received a share next i exhorted to immediate flight my people but in vain they madly scorn d my sober counsel and much wine they drank and sheep and beeves slew num rous on the shore meantime ciconians to ciconians call d their neighbours summoning a mightier host and braver natives of the continent expert on horses mounted to maintain fierce fight or if occasion bade on foot 60 num rous they came as leaves or vernal flow rs at day-spring then by the decree of jove misfortune found us at the ships we stood piercing each other with the brazen spear and till the morning brighten d into noon few as we were we yet withstood them all but when the sun verged westward then the greeks fell back and the ciconian host prevail d six warlike greecians from each galley s crew perish d in that dread field the rest escaped 70 thus after loss of many we pursued our course yet difficult as was our flight went not till first we had invoked by name  our friends whom the ciconians had destroy d but cloud-assembler jove assail d us soon with a tempestuous north-wind earth alike

they quick embark d and on the benches ranged in order thresh d with oars the foamy flood 120 thence o er the deep proceeding sad we reach d the land at length where giant-sized32 and free from all

in front of the cyclopean haven lies a level island not adjoining close their land nor yet remote woody and rude there wild goats breed numberless by no foot of man molested never huntsman there inured to winter s cold and hunger roams the dreary woods or mountain-tops sublime no fleecy flocks dwell there nor plough is known but the unseeded and unfurrow d soil 140 year after year a

fast by the sea a cavern lofty and dark-brow d above with laurels in that cavern slumb ring lay much cattle sheep and goats and a broad court enclosed it fenced with stones from quarries hewn 210 with spiry firs and oaks of ample bough here dwelt a giant vast who far remote his flocks fed solitary converse none desiring sullen savage and unjust monster in truth he was hideous in form resembling less a man by ceres  gift sustain d than some aspiring mountain-crag tufted with wood and standing all alone enjoining then my people to abide fast by the ship which they should closely guard 220 i went but not without a goat-skin fill d with sable wine which i had erst received from maron offspring of evanthes priest of phœbus guardian god of ismarus because through rev rence of him we had saved himself his wife and children for he dwelt amid the grove umbrageous of his god he gave me therefore noble gifts from him sev n talents i received of beaten gold a beaker argent all and after these 230 no fewer than twelve jars with wine replete rich unadult rate drink for gods nor knew one servant male or female of that wine in all his house none knew it save himself his wife and the

thenceforth no pleasure found it to abstain 240 charged with an ample goat-skin of this wine i went and with a wallet well supplied but felt a sudden presage in my soul that haply with terrific force endued  some savage would appear strange to the laws and privileges of the human race few steps convey d us to his den but him we found not he his flocks pastur d abroad his cavern ent ring we with

forth from the sheep-cotes to the rapid bark his kids and lambs and plow the brine again 260 but me they moved not happier had they moved i wish d to see him and to gain perchance some pledge of hospitality at his hands whose form was such as should not much bespeak when he appear d our confidence or love then kindling fire we offer d to the gods and of his cheeses eating patient sat till home he trudged from pasture charged he came with dry wood bundled an enormous load fuel by which to sup loud crash d the thorns 270 which down he cast before the cavern s mouth to whose interior nooks we trembling flew at once he drove into his spacious cave his batten d flock all those which gave him milk but all the males both rams and goats he left abroad excluded from the cavern-yard upheaving next a rocky barrier huge to his cave s mouth he thrust it home that weight not all the oxen from its place had moved of twenty and two wains with such a rock 280 immense his den he closed then down he sat and as he milk d his ewes and bleating goats all in their turns her yeanling gave to each coagulating then with brisk dispatch the half of his new milk he thrust the curd into his

neither flesh nor entrails left nor yet their marrowy bones we viewing that tremendous sight upraised our hands to jove all hope and courage lost 340 when thus the cyclops had with human flesh fill d his capacious belly and had quaff d much undiluted milk among his flocks out-stretch d immense he press d his cavern-floor me then my courage prompted to approach the monster with my sword drawn from the sheath and to transfix him where the vitals wrap the liver but maturer thoughts forbad for so we also had incurred a death tremendous wanting pow r to thrust aside 350 the rocky mass that closed his cavern-mouth by force of hand alone thus many a sigh heaving we watch d the dawn but when at length aurora day-spring s daughter rosy-palm d look d forth then kindling fire his flocks he milk d in

360 his fatted flocks abroad moving with ease that pond rous barrier and replacing it as he had only closed a quiver s lid then hissing them along he drove his flocks toward the mountain and me left the while deep ruminating how i best might take vengeance and by the aid of pallas win deathless renown this counsel pleas d me most beside the sheep-cote lay a massy club hewn by the cyclops from an olive stock 370 green but which dried should serve him for a staff to us consid ring it that staff appear d tall as the mast of a huge trading bark  impell d by twenty rowers o er the deep such seem d

the pointed brand and grind it in his eye when next he slept the lots were cast and four were chosen those whom most i wish d and i was chosen fifth at even-tide he came his fleecy flocks pasturing homeward and compell d them all into his cavern leaving none abroad 390 either through some surmise or so inclined by influence haply of the gods themselves the huge rock pull d into its place again at the cave s mouth he sitting milk d his sheep and goats in order and her kid or lamb thrust under each thus all his work dispatch d two more he seiz d and to his supper fell i then approaching to him thus address d the cyclops holding in my hands a cup of ivy-wood well-charg d with ruddy wine 400 lo cyclops this is wine take this and drink after thy meal of man s flesh taste and learn what precious liquor our lost vessel bore i brought it hither purposing to make libation to thee if to pity inclined thou would st dismiss us home but ah thy rage is insupportable thou cruel one who

tell me too thy name incontinent that i may make requital gratifying also thee with somewhat to thy taste we cyclops own  a bounteous soil which yields us also wine from clusters large nourish d by

drank but when the fumes began to play around the cyclops  brain with show of amity i thus replied cyclops thou hast my noble name enquired which i will tell thee give me in return the promised boon some hospitable pledge my name is outis34 outis i am call d at home abroad wherever i am known so i to whom he savage thus replied 430 outis when i have eaten all his friends shall be my last regale be that thy boon he spake and downward sway d fell resupine with his huge neck aslant all-conqu ring sleep soon seized him from his gullet gush d the wine with human morsels mingled many a blast sonorous issuing from his glutted maw then thrusting far the spike of olive-wood into the embers glowing on the hearth i heated it and cheer d my friends the while 440 lest any should through fear shrink from his part but when that stake of olive-wood though green should soon have flamed for it was glowing hot i bore it to his side then all my aids around me gather d and the gods infused heroic fortitude into our hearts they seizing the hot stake rasp d to a point bored his eye with it and myself advanced to a superior stand twirled it about  as when a shipwright with his wimble bores 450 tough oaken timber placed on either side below his fellow-artists strain the thong alternate and the restless iron spins so grasping hard the stake pointed with fire we twirl d it in his eye the bubbling blood boil d round about the brand his pupil sent a scalding vapour forth that sing d his brow and all his eye-roots crackled in the flame as when the smith an hatchet or large axe temp ring

all my aids fled terrified he plucking forth the spike from his burnt socket mad with anguish cast the implement all bloody far away then bellowing he sounded forth the name of ev ry cyclops dwelling in the caves around him on the wind-swept mountain-tops 470 they at his cry flocking from ev ry part circled his den and of his ail enquired what grievous hurt hath caused thee polypheme thus yelling to alarm the peaceful ear of night and break our slumbers fear st thou lest some mortal man drive off thy flocks or fear st thyself to die by cunning or by force them answer d then polypheme from his

groan d the cyclops wrung with pain and grief and fumbling with stretch d hands removed the rock  from his cave s mouth which done he sat him down 490 spreading his arms athwart the pass to stop our

 all seated took repast short meal we made when with an herald and a chosen friend 70 i sought once more the hall of æolus him banqueting with all his sons we found and with his spouse we ent ring on

with my spear and with my faulchion arm d i left the ship to climb with hasty steps an airy height thence hoping to espie some works of man or hear perchance a voice 180 exalted on a rough rock s

but ere i yet had reach d my gallant bark some god with pity viewing me alone in that untrodden solitude sent forth an antler d stag full-sized into my path his woodland pastures left he sought the stream for he was thirsty and already parch d by the sun s heat him issuing from his haunt sheer through the back beneath his middle spine i wounded and the lance sprang forth beyond moaning he fell and in the dust expired 200 then treading on his breathless trunk i pluck d my weapon forth which leaving there reclined i tore away the osiers with my hands and fallows green and to a fathom s length twisting the gather d twigs into a band bound fast the feet of my enormous prey and flinging him athwart my neck repair d toward my sable bark propp d on my lance which now to carry shoulder d as

much but shall not seek the shades ere yet our destined hour arrive behold a feast and we have wine on board  pine not with needless famine rise and eat i spake they readily obey d and each issuing at my word abroad beside the galley stood admiring as he lay 220 the stag for of no common bulk was he at length their eyes gratified to the full with that glad spectacle they laved their hands and preparation made of noble cheer that day complete till set of sun we spent feasting deliciously without restraint and quaffing generous wine but when the sun went down and darkness overshadow d all extended then on ocean s bank we lay and when aurora daughter of the dawn 230 look d rosy forth convening all my crew to council i arose and thus began my fellow-voyagers however worn  with num rous hardships hear for neither west know ye nor east where rises or where sets the all-enlight ning sun but let us think if thought perchance may profit us of which small hope i see for when i lately climb d yon craggy rock plainly i could discern the land encompass d by the boundless deep 240 the isle is flat and in the midst i saw dun smoke ascending from an oaken bow r so i whom hearing they all courage lost and at remembrance of antiphatas the læstrygonian and the cyclops  deeds ferocious feeder on the flesh of man mourn d loud and wept but tears could nought avail then numb ring man by man i parted them in equal portions and assign d a chief to either band myself to these to those 250 godlike eurylochus this done we cast the lots into the helmet and at once forth sprang the lot of bold eurylochus he went and with him of my people march d twenty and two all weeping nor ourselves wept less at separation from our friends low in a vale but on an open spot they found the splendid

circe singing sweet within while busied at the loom she wove an ample web immortal such a work transparent graceful and of bright design as hands of goddesses alone produce  thus then polites prince

eurylochus toward the ship to tell the woeful tale struggling to speak yet speechless there he stood his heart transfixt with anguish and his eyes deluged with tears me boding terrours occupied at

untoiling sat while managed gales sped swift the bark along then with dejected heart thus i began oh friends for it is needful that not one or two alone the admonition hear 180 of circe beauteous

permits those strains to hear but ye shall bind me with coercion strong of cordage well-secured to the mast-foot and by no struggles to be loos d of mine but should i supplicate to be released 190 or give such order then with added cords be it your part to bind me still the more thus with distinct precaution i prepared my people rapid in her course meantime my gallant bark approach d the sirens  isle for brisk and favourable blew the wind then fell the wind suddenly and serene a breathless calm ensued while all around the billows slumber d lull d by pow r divine up-sprang my people and the folded sails 200  bestowing in the hold sat to their oars which with their polish d blades whiten d the deep i then with edge of steel sev ring minute a waxen cake chafed it and moulded it between my

and arms with strong coercion bound 210 of cordage to the mast-foot well secured then down they sat and rowing thresh d the brine but when with rapid course we had arrived within such distance as a voice may reach not unperceived by them the gliding bark approach d and thus harmonious they began ulysses chief by ev ry tongue extoll d achaia s boast oh hither steer thy bark here stay thy course and listen to our lay these shores none passes in his sable ship 220 till first the warblings of our voice he hear then happier hence and wiser he departs all that the greeks endured and all the ills inflicted by the gods on troy we know know all that passes on the boundless earth so they with voices sweet their music poured melodious on my ear winning with ease my heart s desire to listen and by signs i bade my people instant set me free but they incumbent row d and from their seats 230 eurylochus and perimedes sprang with added cords to bind me still the more this danger past and when the sirens  voice now left remote had lost its pow r to charm then my companions freeing from the wax their ears deliver d me from my restraint the island left afar soon i discern d huge waves and smoke

your seats still occupying smite the furrow d flood with well-timed strokes that by the will of jove we may escape perchance this death secure to thee the pilot thus i speak my words mark thou for at thy touch the rudder moves this smoke and these tumultuous waves avoid steer wide of both yet with an eye intent on yonder rock lest unaware thou hold 260 too near a course and plunge us into harm so i with whose advice all quick complied but scylla i as yet named not that woe without a cure lest terrified my crew should all renounce their oars and crowd below just then forgetful of the strict command of circe not to arm i cloath d me all in radiant armour grasp d two quiv ring spears and to the deck ascended at the prow expecting earliest notice there what time 270 the rock-bred scylla should annoy my friends but i discern d her not nor could although to weariness of sight the dusky rock i vigilant explored thus many a groan heaving we navigated sad the streight for here stood scylla while charybdis there with hoarse throat deep absorb d the briny flood oft as she vomited the deluge forth like water cauldron d o er a furious fire the whirling deep all murmur d and the spray 280 on both those rocky summits fell in show rs but when she suck d the salt wave down again then all the pool appear d wheeling about within the rock rebellow d and the sea drawn off into that gulph disclosed to view the oozy bottom us pale horror seized  thus dreading death with fast-set eyes we watch d charybdis meantime scylla from the bark caught six away the bravest of my friends with eyes that moment on my ship and crew 290 retorted i beheld the legs and arms of those whom she uplifted in the air on me they call d my name the last last time pronouncing then in agony of heart as when from some bold point among the rocks the angler with his taper rod in hand casts forth his bait to snare the smaller fry he swings away remote his guarded line56 then jerks his gasping prey forth from the deep so scylla them raised gasping to the rock 300 and at her cavern s mouth devour d them loud- shrieking and stretching forth to me their arms in sign of hopeless mis ry ne er beheld these eyes in all the seas that i have roam d a sight so piteous nor in all my toils from scylla and charybdis dire escaped we reach d the noble island of the sun ere long where bright hyperion s beauteous herds broad-fronted grazed and his well-batten d flocks i in the bark and on the sea the voice 310 of oxen bellowing in hovels heard and of loud-bleating sheep then dropp d the word into my memory of the sightless seer theban tiresias and the caution strict of circe my ææan monitress who with such force had caution d me to avoid the island of the sun joy of mankind thus then to my companions sad i spake hear ye my friends although long time distress d the words prophetic of the theban seer 320 and of ææan circe whose advice was oft repeated to me to avoid this island of the sun joy of mankind there said the goddess dread your heaviest woes pass the isle therefore scudding swift away i ceased they me with consternation heard and harshly thus eurylochus replied  ulysses ruthless chief no toils impair thy strength of senseless iron thou art form d who thy companions weary and o erwatch d 330 forbidd st to disembark on this fair isle where now at last we might with ease regale thou rash command st us leaving it afar to roam all night the ocean s dreary waste but winds to ships injurious spring by night and how shall we escape a dreadful death if chance a sudden gust from south arise or stormy west that dash in pieces oft the vessel even in the gods  despight prepare we rather now as night enjoins 340 our evening fare beside the sable bark in which at peep of day we may again launch forth secure into the boundless flood he ceas d whom all applauded then i knew that sorrow by the will of adverse heav n approach d and in wing d accents thus replied i suffer force eurylochus and yield o er-ruled by numbers come then swear ye all a solemn oath that should we find an herd or num rous flock none here shall either sheep 350 or bullock slay by appetite profane seduced but shall the viands eat content which from immortal circe we received i spake they readily a solemn oath sware all and when their oath was fully sworn within a creek where a fresh fountain rose they moor d the bark and issuing began brisk preparation of their evening cheer but when nor hunger now nor thirst remain d unsated recollecting then their friends 360 by scylla seized and at her cave devour d they mourn d nor ceased to mourn them till they slept the night s third portion come when now the stars had travers d the mid-sky cloud-gath rer jove call d forth a vehement wind with tempest charged menacing earth and sea with pitchy clouds tremendous and the night fell dark from heav n but when aurora daughter of the day look d rosy forth we haled drawn inland more our bark into a grot where nymphs were wont 370  graceful to tread the dance or to repose convening there my friends i thus began my friends food fails us not but bread is yet and wine on board abstain we from the herds lest harm ensue for ye behold the flocks and herds of a most potent god the sun whose eye and watchful ear none may elude so saying i sway d the gen rous minds of all a month complete the south wind ceaseless blew nor other wind blew next save east and south 380 yet they while neither food nor rosy wine fail d them the herds harm d not through fear to die but our provisions failing they employed whole days in search of food snaring with hooks birds fishes of what kind soe er they might by famine urged i solitary roam d meantime the isle seeking by pray r to move some god to shew us a deliv

answer d with slumbers soft shed o er my eyes and with pernicious art eurylochus the while my friends harangued my friends afflicted as ye are yet hear a fellow-suff rer death however caused abhorrence moves in miserable man but death by famine is a fate of all most to be fear d come let us hither drive 400 and sacrifice to the immortal pow rs the best of all the oxen of the sun resolving thus that soon as we shall reach our native ithaca we will erect to bright hyperion an illustrious fane which with magnificent and num rous gifts we will enrich but should he chuse to sink our vessel for his stately beeves incensed and should with him all heav n conspire our death i rather had with open mouth at once 410 meeting the billows perish than by slow and pining waste here in this desert isle so spake eurylochus whom all approved  then driving all the fattest of the herd few paces only for the sacred beeves grazed rarely distant from the bark they stood compassing them around and grasping each green foliage newly pluck d from saplings tall for barley none in all our bark remain d worshipp d the gods in pray r pray r made they slew and flay d them and the thighs with double fat 421 investing spread them o er with slices crude no wine had they with which to consecrate the blazing rites but with libation poor of water hallow d the interior parts now when the thighs were burnt and each had shared his portion of the maw and when the rest all-slash d and scored hung roasting at the fire sleep in that moment suddenly my eyes forsaking to the shore i bent my way 430 but ere the station of our bark i reach d the sav ry steam greeted me at the scent i wept aloud and to the gods exclaim d oh jupiter and all ye pow rs above with cruel sleep and fatal ye have lull d my cares to rest such horrible offence meantime my rash companions have devised then flew long-stoled lampetia to the sun at once with tidings of his slaughter d beeves and he incensed the immortals thus address d 440 jove and ye everlasting pow rs divine avenge me instant on the crew profane of laertiades ulysses  friends have dared to slay my beeves which i with joy beheld both when i climb d the starry heav ns and when to earth i sloped my westring wheels but if they yield me not amercement due and honourable for my loss to hell i will descend and give the ghosts my beams then thus the cloud-assembler god replied 450 sun shine thou still on the immortal pow rs and on the teeming earth frail man s abode my candent bolts can in a moment reach and split their flying bark in the mid-sea these things calypso told me taught herself by herald hermes as she oft affirm d  but when descending to the shore i reach d at length my bark with aspect stern and tone i reprimanded them yet no redress could frame or remedy the beeves were dead 460 soon follow d signs portentous sent from heav n the skins all crept and on the spits the flesh both roast and raw bellow d as with the voice of living beeves thus my devoted friends driving the fattest oxen of the sun feasted six days entire but when the sev nth by mandate of saturnian jove appeared the storm then ceased to rage and we again embarking launch d our galley rear d the mast and gave our unfurl d canvas to the wind 470 the island left afar and other land appearing none but sky alone and sea right o er the hollow bark saturnian jove hung a cærulean cloud dark ning the deep not long my vessel ran for blowing wild now came shrill zephyrus a stormy gust snapp d sheer the shrouds on both sides backward fell the mast and with loose tackle strew d the hold striking the pilot in the stern it crush d his scull together he a diver s plunge 480 made downward and his noble spirit fled meantime jove thund ring hurl d into the

the mast had fall n but fell encircled with a leathern brace which it retain d binding with this the mast and keel together on them both i sat borne helpless onward by the dreadful gale and now the west subsided and the south arose instead with mis ry charged for me that i might measure back my course again to dire charybdis all night long i drove  and when the sun arose at scylla s rock 500 once more and at charybdis  gulph arrived it was the time when she absorb d profound the briny flood but by a wave upborne i seized the branches fast of the wild-fig57 to which bat-like i clung yet where to fix my foot secure found not or where to ascend for distant lay the roots and distant shot the largest arms erect into the air o ershadowing all charybdis therefore hard i clench d the boughs till she disgorg d again 510 both keel and mast not undesired by me they came though late for at what hour the judge after decision made of num rous strifes58 between young candidates for honour leaves the forum for refreshment  sake at home then was it that the mast and keel emerged deliver d to a voluntary fall fast by those beams i dash d into the flood and seated on them both with oary

their wond rous robes perennial springs water it and it shows a twofold entrance ingress one affords to mortal man which northward looks direct but holier is the southern far by that no mortal enters but the gods alone familiar with that port before they push d 130 the vessel in she rapid plow d the sands with half her keel such rowers urged her on descending from the well-bench d bark ashore they lifted forth ulysses first with all his splendid couch complete then lay d him down still wrapt in balmy slumber on the sands his treasures next by the phæacian chiefs at his departure given him as the meed due to his wisdom at the olive s foot they heap d without the road lest while he slept 140 some passing traveller should rifle them then homeward thence they sped nor ocean s god his threats forgot denounced against divine ulysses but with jove thus first advised eternal sire i shall no longer share respect and reverence among the gods since now phæacia s mortal race have ceas d to honour

had home convey d even had he arrived with all his share allotted to him of the spoils of troy to whom the cloud-assembler god replied 160 what hast thou spoken shaker of the shores wide-ruling neptune fear not thee the gods will ne er despise dangerous were the deed to cast dishonour on a god by birth more ancient and more potent far than they but if profanely rash a mortal man should dare to slight thee to avenge the wrong some future day is ever in thy pow r accomplish all thy pleasure thou art free him answer d then the shaker of the shores 170 jove cloud-enthroned that pleasure i would soon perform as thou hast said but that i watch thy mind continual fearful to offend my purpose is now to destroy amid the dreary deep yon fair phæacian bark return d from safe conveyance of her

that all may wonder seeing her transform d to stone of size to hide their city from the view these words once heard the shaker of the shores instant to scheria maritime abode of the phæacians went arrived he watch d 190 and now the flying bark full near approach d when neptune meeting her with out-spread palm depress d her at a stroke and she became deep-rooted stone then neptune went his way phæacia s ship-ennobled sons meantime conferring stood and thus in accents wing d th  amazed spectator to his fellow spake  ah who hath sudden check d the vessel s course homeward this moment she was all in view thus they unconscious of the cause to whom 200 alcinoüs instructing them replied ye gods a prophecy now strikes my mind with force my father s he was wont to say  neptune resents it that we safe conduct natives of ev ry region to their home he also spake prophetic of a day when a phæacian gallant bark return d after conveyance of a stranger hence should perish in the dreary deep and changed to a huge mountain cover all the town 210 so spake my father all whose words we see this day fulfill d thus therefore act we all unanimous henceforth no longer bear the stranger home when such shall here arrive and we will sacrifice without delay twelve chosen bulls to neptune if perchance he will commiserate us and forbear to hide our town behind a mountain s height he spake they terrified the bulls prepared thus all phæacia s senators and chiefs 220 his altar compassing in pray r adored the ocean s god meantime ulysses woke unconscious where stretch d on his native soil he lay and knew it not long-time exiled for pallas progeny of jove a cloud drew dense around him that ere yet agnized by others he might wisdom learn from her neither to citizens nor yet to friends reveal d nor even to his own espoused till first he should avenge complete his wrongs 230 domestic from those suitors proud sustained all objects therefore in the hero s eyes seem d alien foot-paths long commodious ports heav n-climbing rocks and trees of amplest growth arising fixt he stood his native soil contemplating till with expanded palms both thighs he smote and plaintive thus began ah me what mortal race inhabits here rude are they contumacious and unjust or hospitable and who fear the gods 240 where now shall i secrete these num rous stores  where wander i myself i would that still phæacians own

here lest it become another s prey alas phæacia s chiefs not altogether wise i deem or just 250 who have misplaced me in another land promis d to bear me to the pleasant shores of ithaca but have not so perform d jove guardian of the suppliant s rights who all transgressors marks and punishes all wrong avenge me on the treach rous race but hold  i will revise my stores so shall i know if they have left me here of aught despoiled so saying he number d carefully the gold the vases tripods bright and tissued robes 260 but nothing miss d of all then he bewail d his native isle with pensive steps and slow pacing the border of the billowy flood forlorn but while he wept pallas approach d in form a shepherd stripling girlish fair in feature such as are the sons of kings a sumptuous mantle o er his shoulders hung twice-folded sandals his nice feet upbore and a smooth javelin glitter d in his hand ulysses joyful at the sight his steps 270 turn d brisk toward her whom he thus address d sweet youth since thee of all mankind i first encounter in this land unknown all hail come not with purposes of harm to me these save and save me also i prefer to thee as to some god my pray r and clasp thy knees a suppliant say and tell me true what land what people who inhabit here is this some isle delightful or a shore of fruitful main-land sloping to the sea 280 then pallas thus goddess cærulean-eyed stranger thou sure art simple or hast dwelt far distant hence if of this land thou ask  it is not trust me of so little note but known to many both to those who dwell toward the sun-rise and to others placed behind it distant in the dusky west rugged it is not yielding level course to the swift steed and yet no barren spot however small but rich in wheat and wine 290 nor wants it rain or fertilising dew but pasture green to goats and beeves affords trees of all kinds and fountains never dry ithaca therefore stranger is a name known ev n at troy a city by report at no small distance from achaia s shore the goddess ceased then toil-enduring chief ulysses happy in his native land so taught by pallas progeny of jove in accents wing d her answ ring utter d prompt 300 not truth but figments to truth opposite for guile in him stood never at a pause o er yonder flood even in spacious crete60 i heard of ithaca where now it seems i have myself with these my stores arrived not richer stores than flying thence i left to my own children for from crete i fled for slaughter of orsilochus the swift son of idomeneus whom none in speed could equal throughout all that spacious isle 310 his purpose was to plunder me of all my trojan spoils which to obtain much woe i had in battle and by storms endured for that i would not gratify his sire fighting beside him in the fields of troy but led a diff rent band him from the field returning homeward with my brazen spear i smote in ambush waiting his return at the road-side with a confed rate friend unwonted darkness over all the heav ns 320 that night prevailed nor any eye of man observed us but unseen i slew the youth no sooner then with my sharp spear of life  i had bereft him than i sought a ship mann d by renown d phæacians whom with gifts part of my spoils and by requests i won i bade them land me on the pylian shore or in fair elis by th  epeans ruled but they reluctant were by violent winds driv n devious thence for fraud they purposed none 330 thus through constraint we here arrived by night and with much difficulty push d the ship into safe harbour nor was mention made of food by any though all needed food but disembark d in haste on shore we lay i weary slept profound and they my goods forth heaving from the bark beside me placed the treasures on the sea-beach where i slept then reimbarking to the populous coast steer d of sidonia and me left forlorn 340 he ceased then smiled minerva azure-eyed and stroaked his cheek in form a woman now beauteous majestic in all elegant arts accomplish d and with accents wing d replied who passes thee in artifice well-framed and in imposture various need shall find of all his policy although a god canst thou not cease inventive as thou art and subtle from the wiles which thou hast lov d since thou wast infant and from tricks of speech 350 delusive even in thy native land but come dismiss we these ingenious shifts from our discourse in which we both excel for thou of all men in expedients most abound st and eloquence and i throughout all heav n have praise for wisdom and for art and know st thou not thine athenæan aid pallas jove s daughter who in all thy toils assist thee and defend i gave thee pow r t  engage the hearts of all phæacia s sons 360 and here arrive ev n now counsels to frame discrete with thee and to conceal the stores giv n to thee by the rich phæacian chiefs on my suggestion at thy going thence i will inform thee also what distress and hardship under thy own palace-roof  thou must endure which since constraint enjoins bear patiently and neither man apprize nor woman that thou hast arrived forlorn and vagabond but silent undergo 370 what wrongs soever from the hands of men to whom ulysses ever-wise replied o goddess thou art able to elude wherever met the keenest eye of man for thou all shapes assum st yet this i know certainly that i ever found thee kind long as achaia s heroes fought at troy but when the lofty tow

rid me of my num rous woes but always bearing in my breast a heart with anguish riv n i roam d till by the gods relieved at length and till with gracious words thyself didst in phæacia s opulent land confirm my courage and becam st my guide but i adjure thee in thy father s name  o tell me truly for i cannot hope 390 that i have reach d fair ithaca i tread some other soil and thou affirm st it mine to mock me merely and deceive oh say  am i in ithaca in truth at home thus then minerva the cærulean-eyed such caution in thy breast always prevails distrustful but i know thee eloquent with wisdom and with ready thought endued and cannot leave thee therefore thus distress d for what man save ulysses new-return d 400 after long wand rings would not pant to see at once his home his children and his wife but thou preferr st neither to know nor ask concerning them till some experience first thou make of her whose wasted youth is spent in barren solitude and who in tears ceaseless her nights and woeful days consumes i ne er was ignorant but well foreknew that not till after loss of all thy friends  thou should st return but loth i was to oppose 410 neptune my father s brother sore incensed for his son s sake deprived of sight by thee but i will give thee proof come now survey these marks of ithaca and be convinced this is the port of phorcys sea-born sage that the huge olive at the haven s head fast by it thou behold st the pleasant cove umbrageous to the nymphs devoted named the naiads this the broad-arch d cavern is where thou wast wont to offer to the nymphs 420 many a whole hecatomb and yonder stands the mountain neritus with forests cloath d so saying the goddess scatter d from before his eyes all darkness and he knew the land then felt ulysses hero toil-inured transport unutterable seeing plain once more his native isle he kiss d the glebe and with uplifted hands the nymphs ador d nymphs naiads jove s own daughters i despair d to see you more whom yet with happy vows 430 i now can hail again gifts as of old we will hereafter at your shrines present if jove-born pallas huntress of the spoils grant life to me and manhood to my son then pallas blue-eyed progeny of jove take courage trouble not thy mind with thoughts now needless haste delay not far within this hallow d cave s recess place we at once thy precious stores that they may thine remain then muse together on thy wisest course 440 so saying the goddess enter d deep the cave caliginous and its secret nooks explored from side to side meantime ulysses brought all his stores into it the gold the brass and robes magnificent his gifts received from the phæacians safe he lodg d them all and pallas daughter of jove ægis-arm d closed fast herself the cavern with a stone then on the consecrated olive s root both seated they in consultation plann d 450 the deaths of those injurious suitors proud and pallas blue-eyed goddess thus began  laertes  noble son ulysses think by what means likeliest thou shalt assail those shameless suitors who have now controuled three years thy family thy matchless wife with language amorous and with spousal gifts urging importunate but she with tears watching thy wish d return hope gives to all by messages of promise sent to each 460 framing far other purposes the while then answer thus ulysses wise return d ah agamemnon s miserable fate had surely met me in my own abode but for thy gracious warning pow r divine come then devise the means teach me thyself the way to vengeance and my soul inspire with daring fortitude as when we loos d her radiant frontlet from the brows of troy would st thou with equal zeal o pallas aid 470 thy servant here i would encounter thrice an hundred enemies let me but perceive thy dread divinity my prompt ally him answer d then pallas cærulean-eyed and such i will be not unmark d by me let once our time of enterprize arrive shalt thou assail them many as i judge of those proud suitors who devour thy wealth shall leave their brains then on thy palace floor but come behold i will disguise thee so 480 that none shall know thee i will parch the skin on thy fair body i will cause thee shed thy wavy locks i will enfold thee round in such a kirtle as the eyes of all shall loath to look on and i will deform with blurring rheums thy eyes so vivid erst so shall the suitors deem thee and thy wife and thy own son whom thou didst leave at home some sordid wretch obscure but seek thou first thy swine-herd s mansion he alike intends 490 thy good and loves affectionate thy son and thy penelope thou shalt find the swain tending his herd they feed beneath the rock corax at side of arethusa s fount on acorns dieted nutritious food  to them and drinking of the limpid stream there waiting question him of thy concerns while i from sparta praised for women fair call home thy son telemachus a guest with menelaus now whom to consult 500 in spacious lacedæmon he is gone anxious to learn if yet his father lives to whom ulysses ever-wise replied and why alas all-knowing as thou art him left st thou ignorant was it that he he also wand ring wide the barren deep might suffer woe while these devour his wealth him answer d then pallas cærulean-eyed grieve thou not much for him i sent him forth myself that there arrived he might acquire 510 honour and fame no suff rings finds he there but in atrides  palace safe resides enjoying all abundance him in truth the suitors watch close ambush d on the deep intent to slay him ere he reach his home but shall not as i judge till of themselves the earth hide some who make thee now a prey so saying the goddess touch d him with a wand at once o er all his agile limbs she parch d the polish d skin she wither d to the root 520 his wavy locks and cloath d him with the hide deform d of wrinkled age she charged with rheums his eyes before so vivid and a cloak and kirtle gave him tatter d both and foul and smutch d with smoak then casting over

seeking ulysses  son 530 to lacedæmon s spacious realm repair d   leaving the haven-side he turn d his steps into a rugged path which over hills mantled with trees led him to the abode by pallas mention d of his noble friend61 the swine-herd who of all ulysses  train watch d with most diligence his rural stores him sitting in the vestibule he found of his own airy lodge commodious built amidst a level lawn that structure neat eumæus in the absence of his lord 10 had raised himself with stones from quarries hewn unaided by laertes or the queen with tangled thorns he fenced it safe around and with contiguous stakes riv n from the trunks of solid oak black-grain d hemm d it without twelve penns he made within all side by side lairs for his swine and fast-immured in each lay fifty pregnant females on the floor the males all slept without less num rous far thinn d by the princely wooers at their feasts 20 continual for to them he ever sent the fattest of his saginated charge three hundred still and sixty brawns remained four mastiffs in adjoining kennels lay resembling wild-beasts nourish d at the board of the illustrious steward of the styes himself sat fitting sandals to his feet carved from a stain d ox-hide four hinds he kept now busied here and there three in the penns  were occupied meantime the fourth had sought 30 the city whither for the suitors  use with no good will but by constraint he drove a boar that sacrificing to the gods th  imperious guests might on his flesh regale soon as those clamorous watch-dogs the approach saw of ulysses baying loud they ran toward him he as ever well-advised squatted and let his staff fall from his hand yet foul indignity he had endured ev n there at his own farm but that the swain 40 following his dogs in haste sprang through the porch to his assistance letting fall the hide with chiding voice and vollied stones he soon drove them apart and thus his lord bespake old man one moment more and these my dogs had past doubt worried thee who should st have proved so slain a source of obloquy to me but other pangs the gods and other woes to me have giv n who here lamenting sit my godlike master and his fatted swine 50 nourish for others  use while he perchance a wand rer in some foreign city seeks fit sustenance and none obtains if still indeed he live and view the light of day but old friend follow me into the house that thou at least with plenteous food refresh d and cheer d with wine sufficient may st disclose both who thou art and all that thou hast borne so saying the gen rous swine-herd introduced ulysses and thick bundles spread of twigs 60 beneath him cover d with the shaggy skin of a wild goat of which he made his couch easy and large the hero so received rejoiced and thus his gratitude express d jove grant thee and the gods above my host for such beneficence thy chief desire to whom eumæus thou didst thus reply my guest i should offend treating with scorn the stranger though a poorer should arrive than ev n thyself for all the poor that are 70 and all the strangers are the care of jove little and with good will is all that lies  within my scope no man can much expect from servants living in continual fear under young masters for the gods no doubt have intercepted my own lord s return from whom great kindness i had else received with such a recompense as servants gain from gen rous masters house and competence and lovely wife from many a wooer won 80 whose industry should have requited well his goodness with such blessing from the gods as now attends me in my present charge much had i therefore prosper d had my lord grown old at home but he hath died i would that the whole house of helen one and all might perish too for she hath many slain who like my master went glory to win for agamemnon in the fields of troy so saying he girdled quick his tunic close 90 and issuing sought the styes thence bringing two of the imprison d herd he slaughter d both singed them and slash d and spitted them and placed the whole well-roasted banquet spits and all reeking before ulysses last with flour he sprinkled them and filling with rich wine his ivy goblet to his master sat opposite whom inviting thus he said now eat my guest such as a servant may i set before thee neither large of growth 100 nor fat the fatted those the suitors eat fearless of heav n and pitiless of man yet deeds unjust as theirs the blessed gods love not they honour equity and right even an hostile band when they invade a foreign shore which by consent of jove they plunder and with laden ships depart even they with terrours quake of wrath divine but these are wiser these must sure have learn d from some true oracle my master s death 110 who neither deign with decency to woo nor yet to seek their homes but boldly waste his substance shameless now and sparing nought jove ne er hath giv n us yet the night or day when with a single victim or with two  they would content them and his empty jars witness how fast the squand rers use his wine time was when he was rich indeed such wealth no hero own d on yonder continent nor yet in ithaca no twenty chiefs 120 could match with all their treasures his alone i tell thee their amount twelve herds of his the mainland graze62 as many flocks of sheep as many droves of swine and hirelings there and servants of his own seed for his use as many num rous flocks of goats his goats not fewer than eleven num rous flocks here also graze the margin of his fields under the eye of servants well-approved and ev ry servant ev ry day brings home 130 the goat of all his flock largest and best but as for me i have these swine in charge of which selected with exactest care from all the herd i send the prime to them he ceas d meantime ulysses ate and drank voracious meditating mute the death of those proud suitors his repast at length concluded and his appetite sufficed eumæus gave him charged with wine the cup from which he drank himself he glad received 140 the boon and in wing d accents thus began my friend and who was he wealthy and brave as thou describ st the chief who purchased thee thou say st he perish d for the glory-sake of agamemnon name him i perchance may have beheld the hero none can say but jove and the inhabitants of heav n that i ne er saw him and may not impart news of him i have roam d through many a clime to whom the noble swine-herd thus replied 150 alas old man no trav ler s tale of him will gain his consort s credence or his son s for wand rers wanting entertainment forge falsehoods for bread and wilfully deceive no wand rer lands in ithaca but he seeks  with feign d intelligence my mistress  ear she welcomes all and while she questions each minutely from her lids lets fall the tear affectionate as well beseems a wife whose mate hath perish d in a distant land 160 thou could st thyself no doubt my hoary friend would any furnish thee with decent vest and mantle fabricate a tale with ease yet sure it is that dogs and fowls long since his skin have stript or fishes of the deep have eaten him and on some distant shore whelm d in deep sands his mould ring bones are laid so hath he perish d whence to all his friends but chiefly to myself sorrow of heart for such another lord gentle as he 170 wherever sought i have no hope to find though i should wander even to the house of my own father neither yearns my heart so feelingly though that desiring too to see once more my parents and my home as to behold ulysses yet again ah stranger absent as he is his name fills me with rev rence for he lov d me much cared for me much and though we meet no more holds still an elder brother s part in me 180 him answer d then the hero toil-inured my friend since his return in thy account is an event impossible and thy mind always incredulous that hope rejects i shall not slightly speak but with an oath  ulysses comes again and i demand no more than that the boon such news deserves be giv n me soon as he shall reach his home then give me vest and mantle fit to wear which ere that hour much as i need them both 190 i neither ask nor will accept from thee for him whom poverty can force aside from truth i hate him as the gates of hell be jove of all in heav n my witness first then this thy hospitable board and last the household gods of the illustrious chief himself ulysses to whose gates i go that all my words shall surely be fulfill d  in this same year ulysses shall arrive ere this month closed another month succeed 200 he shall return and punish all who dare insult his consort and his noble son to whom eumæus thou didst thus reply old friend that boon thou wilt ne er earn from me ulysses comes no more but thou thy wine drink quietly and let us find at length some other theme recall not this again to my remembrance for my soul is grieved oft as reminded of my honour d lord let the oath rest and let ulysses come 210 ev n as myself and as penelope and as his ancient father and his son godlike telemachus all wish he may ay there i feel again nor cease to mourn his son telemachus who when the gods had giv n him growth like a young plant and i well hoped that nought inferior he should prove in person or in mind to his own sire hath lost through influence human or divine i know not how his sober intellect 220 and after tidings of his sire is gone to far-famed pylus his return meantime in ambush hidden the proud suitors wait that the whole house may perish of renown d arcesias named in ithaca no more but whether he have fallen or  scaped let him rest also whom saturnian jove protect but come my ancient guest now let me learn thy own afflictions answer me in truth who and whence art thou in what city born 230 where dwell thy parents in what kind of ship cam st thou the mariners why brought they thee to ithaca and of what land are they for that on foot thou found st us not is sure him answer d then ulysses ever-wise i will with truth resolve thee and if here within thy cottage sitting we had wine and food for many a day and business none but to regale at ease while others toiled i could exhaust the year complete my woes 240 rehearsing nor at last rehearse entire  my sorrows by the will of heav n sustained i boast me sprung from ancestry renown d in spacious crete son of a wealthy sire who other sons train d num rous in his house born of his wedded wife but he begat me on his purchased concubine whom yet dear as his other sons in wedlock born castor hylacides esteem d and lov d for him i boast my father him in crete 250 while yet he liv d all reverenc d as a god so rich so prosp rous and so blest was he with sons of highest praise but death the doom of all him bore to pluto s drear abode and his illustrious sons among themselves portion d his goods by lot to me indeed they gave a dwelling and but little more yet for my virtuous qualities i won a wealthy bride for i was neither vain nor base forlorn as thou perceiv st me now 260 but thou canst guess i judge viewing the straw what once was in the ear ah i have borne much tribulation heap d and heavy woes courage and phalanx-breaking might had i from mars and pallas at what time i drew planning some dread exploit an ambush forth of our most valiant chiefs no boding fears of death seized me but foremost far of all i sprang to fight and pierced the flying foe such was i once in arms but household toils 270 sustain d for children s sake and carking cares t  enrich a family were not for me my pleasures were the gallant bark the din of battle the smooth spear and glitt ring shaft objects of dread to others but which me the gods disposed to love and to enjoy thus diff rent minds are diff rently amused for ere achaia s fleet had sailed to troy nine times was i commander of an host embark d against a foreign foe and found 280 in all those enterprizes great success from the whole booty first what pleased me most chusing and sharing also much by lot i rapidly grew rich and had thenceforth  among the cretans rev rence and respect but when loud-thund ring jove that voyage dire ordain d which loos d the knees of many a greek then to idomeneus and me they gave the charge of all their fleet which how to avoid we found not so importunate the cry 290 of the whole host impell d us to the task there fought we nine long years and in the tenth priam s proud city pillag d steer d again our galleys homeward which the gods dispersed then was it that deep-planning jove devised for me much evil one short month no more i gave to joys domestic in my wife happy and in my babes and in my wealth when the desire seiz d me with sev ral ships well-rigg d and furnish d all with gallant crews 300 to sail for ægypt nine i fitted forth to which stout mariners assembled fast six days the chosen partners of my voyage feasted to whom i num rous victims gave for sacrifice and for their own regale embarking on the sev nth from spacious crete before a clear breeze prosp rous from the north we glided easily along as down a river s stream nor one of all my ships damage incurr d but healthy and at ease 310 we sat while gales well-managed urged us on

hill-tops but they under the impulse of a spirit rash and hot for quarrel the well-cultur d fields pillaged of the ægyptians captive led their wives and little ones and slew the men 320 soon was the city alarm d and at the cry down came the citizens by dawn of day with horse and foot and with the gleam of arms filling the plain then jove with panic dread struck all my people none found courage more to stand for mischiefs swarm d on ev ry side there num rous by the glittering spear we fell  slaughter d while others they conducted thence alive to servitude but jove himself my bosom with this thought inspired i would 330 that dying i had first fulfill d my fate in ægypt for new woes were yet to come loosing my brazen casque and slipping off my buckler there i left them on the field then

ulysses had amass d a store to feed a less illustrious family than his to the tenth generation so immense his treasures in the royal palace lay himself he said was to dodona gone there from the tow

ship was launch d and the crew ready for his conduct home but me he first dismiss d for as it chanced a ship lay there of the thesprotians bound to green dulichium s isle he bade the crew bear me to king acastus with all speed but them far other thoughts pleased more and thoughts of harm to me that i might yet be plunged in deeper gulphs of woe than i had known 410 for when the billow-cleaving bark had left the land remote framing combined a plot against my liberty they stripp d my vest  and mantle and this tatter d raiment foul gave me instead which thy own eyes behold at even-tide reaching the cultur d coast of ithaca they left me bound on board with tackle of the bark and quitting ship themselves made hasty supper on the shore but me meantime the gods easily loos d 420 by

landing where thick covert of luxuriant trees i mark d close couchant down i lay they mutt ring loud paced to and fro but deeming farther search unprofitable soon embark d again thus baffling all their search with ease the gods 430 conceal d and led me thence to the abode of a wise man dooming me still to live to whom eumæus thou didst thus reply alas my most compassionable guest thou hast much moved me by this tale minute of thy sad wand rings and thy num rous woes but speaking of ulysses thou hast pass d all credence i at least can give thee none why noble as thou art should st thou invent palpable falsehoods as for the return 440 of my regretted lord myself i know that had he not been hated by the gods unanimous he had in battle died at troy or that long doubtful war at last concluded in his people s arms at home then universal greece had raised his tomb and he had even for his son atchiev d immortal glory but alas by beaks of harpies torn unseemly sight he lies here is my home the while i never seek 450 the city unless summon d by discrete penelope to listen to the news brought by some stranger whencesoe er arrived then all alike inquisitive attend both who regret the absence of our king and who rejoice gratuitous to gorge  his property but as for me no joy find i in list ning after such reports since an ætolian cozen d me who found after long wand ring over various lands 460 a fugitive for blood my lone retreat him warm i welcom d and with open arms receiv d who bold affirm d that he had seen my master with idomeneus at crete his ships refitting shatter

gratify me with untruths 470 and to deceive me since for no such cause i shall respect or love thee but alone by pity influenced and the fear of jove to whom ulysses ever-wise replied thou hast in truth a most incredulous mind whom even with an oath i have not moved or aught persuaded come then let us make in terms express a cov nant and the gods who hold olympus witness to us both if thy own lord at this thy house arrive 480 thou shalt dismiss me decently attired in vest and mantle that i may repair hence to dulichium whither i would go but if thy lord come not then gath ring all thy servants headlong hurl me from a rock that other mendicants may fear to lie to whom the generous swine-herd in return yes stranger doubtless i should high renown obtain for virtue among men both now and in all future times if having first 490 invited thee and at my board regaled i next should slay thee then my pray rs would mount past question swiftly to saturnian jove but the hour calls to supper and ere long the partners of my toils will come prepared to spread the board with no unsav ry cheer thus they conferr d and now the swains arrived driving their charge which fast they soon enclosed within their customary penns and loud  the hubbub was of swine prison d within 500 then call d the master to his rustic train bring ye the best that we may set him forth before my friend from foreign climes arrived with whom ourselves will also feast who find the bright-tusk d multitude a painful charge while others at no cost of theirs consume day after day the profit of our toils so saying his wood for fuel he prepared and dragging thither a well-fatted brawn of the fifth year his servants held him fast 510 at the hearth-side nor failed the master swain t  adore the gods for wise and good was he but consecration of the victim first himself performing cast into the fire the forehead bristles of the tusky boar then pray d to all above that safe at length ulysses might regain his native home then lifting an huge shive that lay beside the fire he smote the boar and dead he fell next piercing him and scorching close his hair 520 they carv d him quickly and eumæus spread thin slices crude taken from ev ry limb o er all his fat then other slices cast sprinkling them first with meal into the fire the rest they slash d and scored and roasted well and placed it heap d together on the board then rose the good eumæus to his task of distribution for he understood the hospitable entertainer s part sev n-fold partition of the banquet made 530 he gave with previous pray r to maia

thus the hero spake eumæus be thou as belov d of jove as thou art dear to me whom though attired so coarsely thou hast served with such respect to whom eumæus thou didst thus reply 540 eat noble stranger and refreshment take  such as thou may st god64 gives and god denies at his own will for he is lord of all he said and to the everlasting gods the firstlings sacrificed of all then made libation and the cup placed in the hands of city-spoiler laertiades sitting beside his own allotted share meantime mesaulius bread dispensed to all whom in the absence of his lord himself 550 eumæus had from taphian traders bought with his own proper goods at no expence either to old laertes or the queen and now all stretch d their hands toward the feast reeking before them and when hunger none

ever wat ry west 560 ulysses at that sound for trial sake of his good host if putting off his cloak he would accommodate him or require that service for him at some other hand addressing thus the family began hear now eumæus and ye other swains his fellow-lab rers i shall somewhat boast by wine befool d which forces ev n the wise to carol loud to titter and to dance and words to utter oft better suppress d 570 but since i have begun i shall proceed prating my fill ah might those days return with all the youth and strength that i enjoy d when in close ambush once at troy we lay ulysses menelaus and myself their chosen coadjutor led the band approaching to the city s lofty wall through the thick bushes and the reeds that gird  the bulwarks down we lay flat in the marsh under our arms

arose who casting off his cloak ran thence toward the ships and folded warm 610 within it there lay i till dawn appear d oh for the vigour of such youth again then some good peasant here either for love or for respect would cloak a man like me whom now thus sordid in attire ye scorn to whom eumæus thou didst thus reply my ancient guest i cannot but approve thy narrative nor hast thou utter d aught unseemly or that needs excuse no want of raiment therefore or of aught beside 620 needful to solace penury like thine  shall harm thee here yet at the peep of dawn gird thy own tatters to thy loins again for we have no great store of cloaks to boast or change of vests but singly one for each but when ulysses  son shall once arrive he will himself with vest and mantle both cloath thee and send thee whither most thou would st so saying he rose and nearer made his couch to the hearth-side spreading it thick with skins 630 of sheep and goats then lay the hero down o er whom a shaggy mantle large he threw which oft-times served him with a change when rough the winter s blast and terrible arose so was ulysses bedded and the youths slept all beside him but the master-swain chose not his place of rest so far remote from his rude charge but to the outer court with his nocturnal furniture repair d gladd ning ulysses  heart that one so true 640 in his own absence kept his rural stores athwart his sturdy shoulders first he flung his faulchion keen then wrapp d him in a cloak thick-woven winter-proof he lifted next the skin of a well-thriven goat in bulk surpassing others and his javelin took sharp-pointed with which dogs he drove and men thus arm d he sought his wonted couch beneath a hollow rock where the herd slept secure from the sharp current of the northern blast 650   meantime to lacedæmon s spacious vale minerva went that she might summon thence ulysses  glorious son to his own home arrived she found telemachus reposed and nestor s son beneath the vestibule of menelaus mighty chief she saw pisistratus in bands of gentle sleep fast-bound but not telemachus his mind no rest enjoy d by filial cares disturb d amid the silent night when drawing near 10 to his

mark it in the frith samos the rude and ithaca between the chief of all her suitors thy return in vigilant ambush wait with strong desire to slay thee ere thou reach thy native shore but shall not as i judge till the earth hide 40 many a lewd reveller at thy expence yet steer thy galley from those isles afar and voyage make by night some guardian god shall save thee and shall send thee prosp rous gales then soon as thou attain st the nearest shore of ithaca dispatching to the town thy bark with all thy people seek at once the swine-herd for eumæus is thy friend there sleep and send him forth into the town with tidings to penelope that safe 50 thou art restored from pylus home again she said and sought th  olympian heights sublime then with his heel shaking him he awoke the son of nestor whom he thus address d rise nestor s son pisistratus lead forth the steeds and yoke them we must now depart to whom the son of nestor thus replied telemachus what haste soe er we feel we can by no means prudently attempt to drive by night and soon it will be dawn 60 stay therefore till the hero atreus  son spear-practis d menelaus shall his gifts place in the chariot and with kind farewell dismiss thee for the guest in mem ry holds through life the host who treats him as a friend scarce had he spoken when the golden dawn appearing menelaus from the side of beauteous helen ris n their

thus address d  atrides menelaus chief renown d dismiss me hence to ithaca again my native isle for i desire to go him answer d menelaus famed in arms telemachus i will not long delay thy wish d return i disapprove alike the host whose assiduity extreme 80 distresses and whose negligence offends the middle course is best alike we err him thrusting forth whose wish is to remain and hind ring the impatient to depart this only is true kindness to regale the present guest and speed him when he would yet stay till thou shalt see my splendid gifts placed in thy chariot and till i command my women from our present stores to spread the table with a plentiful repast 90 for both the honour of the guest demands and his convenience also that he eat sufficient ent ring on a length of road but if through hellas thou wilt take thy way and traverse argos i will then myself attend thee thou shalt journey with my steeds beneath thy yoke and i will be thy guide to many a city whence we shall not go ungratified but shall in each receive some gift at least tripod or charger bright 100 or golden chalice or a pair of mules to whom telemachus discrete replied atrides menelaus chief renown d i would at once depart for guardian none of my possessions have i left behind lest while i seek my father i be lost myself or lose what i should grudge to spare which when the valiant menelaus heard he bade his spouse and maidens spread the board at once with remnants of the last regale 110 then eteoneus came boetheus  son newly aris n for nigh at hand he dwelt whom menelaus bade kindle the fire by

producing one in size and in magnificence the chief a star for splendour and the lowest placed of all loveliest of her sex she bore it thence then all proceeding through the house they sought telemachus again whom reaching thus the hero of the golden locks began may jove the thunderer dread juno s mate 130 grant thee telemachus such voyage home as thy own heart desires accept from all my stores selected as the richest far and noblest gift for finish d beauty this i give thee wrought elaborate a cup itself all silver bound with lip of gold it is the work of vulcan which to me the hero phædimus imparted king of the sidonians when on my return beneath his roof i lodg d i make it thine 140 so saying the hero atreus  son the cup placed in his hands and megapenthes set before him next the argent beaker bright but lovely helen drawing nigh the robe presented to him whom she thus address d i also give thee oh my son a gift which seeing thou shalt think on her whose hands wrought it a

accepted glad and in the chariot-chest pisistratus the hero all disposed admiring them the while they following next the hero menelaus to his hall each on his couch or on his throne reposed a maiden then with golden ewer charged and silver bowl pour d water on their hands  and spread the polish d table which with food 160 various selected from her present stores the mistress of the household charge supplied boetheus  son stood carver and to each his portion gave while megapenthes son of glorious menelaus serv d the cup then all with outstretch d hands the feast assail d and when nor hunger more nor thirst of wine they felt telemachus and nestor s son yoked the swift steeds and taking each his seat in the resplendent chariot drove at once 170 right through the sounding portico

sight rejoicing and with hearts reviv d they view d and thus pisistratus his speech amid them all to menelaus turn d now menelaus think illustrious chief if us this omen or thyself regard 200 while warlike menelaus musing stood what answer fit to frame helen meantime  his spouse long-stoled preventing him began hear me for i will answer as the gods teach me and as i think shall come to pass as he descending from his place of birth the mountains caught our pamper d goose away so shall ulysses after many woes and wand rings to his home restored avenge his wrongs or even now is at his home 210 for all those suitors sowing seeds of woe to whom telemachus discrete replied oh grant it jove juno s high-thund ring mate so will i there arrived with vow and pray r thee worship as thou wert thyself divine he said and lash d the coursers fiery they and fleet sprang through the city to the plain all day the yoke on either side they shook journeying swift and now the setting sun to gloomy evening

but performance kind of my request we are not bound alone to friendship by the friendship of our sires but by equality of years and this our journey shall unite us still the more bear me not i intreat thee noble friend beyond the ship but drop me at her side 240 lest ancient nestor though against my will detain me in his palace through desire to feast me for i dread the least delay he spake then mused pisistratus how best he might effect the wishes of his friend  and thus at length resolved turning his steeds with sudden deviation to the shore he sought the bark and placing in the stern both gold and raiment the illustrious gifts of menelaus thus in accents wing d 250 with ardour urged telemachus away dispatch embark summon thy crew on board ere my arrival notice give of thine to the old

saying he to the pylian city urged his steeds bright-maned and at the palace-gate 260 arrived of nestor speedily meantime telemachus exhorted thus his crew my gallant friends set all your tackle climb

saying he at the stranger s hand received his spear which on the deck he lay d then climb d himself the bark and seated in the stern at his own side placed theoclymenus they cast the hawsers loose

found it yet some solace to converse with her who rear d me in my childish days together with her lovely youngest-born 440 the princess ctimena for side by side we grew and i scarce honour d less than

recollection of our sufferings past for who hath much endured and wander d far finds the recital ev n of sorrow sweet now hear thy question satisfied attend there is an island thou hast heard perchance of such an isle named syria68 it is placed 490  above ortigia and a dial owns69 true to the tropic changes of the year no great extent she boasts yet is she rich in cattle and in flocks in wheat and wine no famine knows that people or disease noisome of all that elsewhere seize the race of miserable man but when old age steals on the citizens apollo arm d with silver bow and bright

such means it chanced that e er i saw the isle in which i dwell to whom ulysses glorious chief replied eumæus thou hast moved me much thy woes enumerating thus at large but jove hath neighbour d all thy evil with this good 590 that after num rous sorrows thou hast reach d the house of a kind master at whose hands thy sustenance is sure and here thou lead st a tranquil life but i have late arrived city after city of the world explored thus mutual they conferr d nor leisure found save for short sleep by morning soon surprized meantime the comrades of telemachus approaching land cast loose the sail and lower d alert the mast then oar d the vessel in 600 the anchors heav d aground71 and hawsers tied secure themselves forth-issuing on the shore breakfast prepared and charged their cups with wine when neither hunger now nor thirst remained unsatisfied telemachus began push ye the sable bark without delay home to the city i will to the field among my shepherds and my rural works survey d at eve will to the town return to-morrow will i set before you wine 610 and plenteous viands wages of your toil to whom the godlike theoclymenus whither must i my son who of the chiefs  of rugged ithaca shall harbour me shall i to thine and to thy mother s house then thus telemachus discrete replied i would invite thee to proceed at once to our abode since nought should fail thee there of kind reception but it were a course now not adviseable for i must myself 620 be absent neither would my mother s eyes behold thee so unfrequent she appears before the suitors shunning whom she sits weaving continual at the palace-top but i will name to thee another chief whom thou may st seek eurymachus the son renown d of prudent polybus whom all the people here reverence as a god far noblest of them all is he and seeks more ardent than his rivals far to wed 630 my mother and to fill my father s throne but he who dwells above jove only knows if some disastrous day be not ordain d for them or ere those nuptials shall arrive while thus he spake at his right hand appear d messenger of apollo on full wing a falcon in his pounces clench d he bore a dove which rending down he pour d her plumes

hath wing d propitious soon as i perceived i knew him ominous in all the isle no family of a more royal note than yours is found and yours shall still prevail whom thus telemachus answer d discrete grant heav n my guest that this good word of thine fail not and soon thou shalt such bounty share 650 and friendship at my hands that at first sight whoe er shall meet thee shall pronounce thee blest then to piræus thus his friend approved piræus son of clytius for of all my followers to the shore of pylus none more prompt than thou hath my desires perform d  now also to thy own abode conduct this stranger whom with hospitable care cherish and honour till myself arrive to whom piræus answer d spear-renown d 660 telemachus however long thy stay punctual i will attend him and no want of hospitality shall he find with me so saying he climb d the ship then bade the crew embarking also cast the hawsers loose and each obedient to his bench repair d meantime telemachus his sandals bound and lifted from the deck his glitt ring spear then as telemachus had bidden them son of divine ulysses casting loose 670 the hawsers forth they push d into the deep and sought the city while with nimble pace proceeding thence telemachus attain d the cottage soon where good eumæus slept the swine-herd faithful to his num rous charge   it was the hour of dawn when in the cot kindling fresh fire ulysses and his friend noble eumæus dress d their morning fare and sent the herdsmen with the swine abroad seeing telemachus the watchful dogs bark d not but fawn d around him at that sight and at the sound of feet which now approach d ulysses in wing d accents thus remark d eumæus certain either friend of thine is nigh at hand or one whom well thou know st 10 thy dogs bark not but fawn on his approach obsequious and the sound of feet i hear scarce had he ceased when his own son himself stood in the vestibule upsprang at once eumæus wonder-struck and from his hand let fall the cups with which he was employ d mingling rich wine to his young lord he ran his forehead kiss d kiss d his bright-beaming eyes and both his hands weeping profuse the while as when a father folds in his embrace 20 arrived from foreign lands in the tenth year his darling son the offspring of his age his only one for whom he long hath mourn d so kiss d the noble peasant o er and o er godlike telemachus as from death escaped and in wing d accents plaintive thus began light of my eyes thou com st it is thyself sweetest telemachus i had no hope to see thee more once told that o er the deep thou hadst departed for the pylian coast 30 enter my precious son that i may sooth  my soul with sight of thee from far arrived for seldom thou thy feeders and thy farm visitest in the city custom d much to make abode that thou may st witness there the manners of those hungry suitors proud to whom telemachus discrete replied it will be so there is great need my friend but here for thy sake have i now arrived that i may look on thee and from thy lips 40 learn if my mother still reside at home or have become spouse of some other chief leaving untenanted ulysses  bed to be by noisome spiders webb d around to whom the master swine-herd in return not so she patient still as ever dwells beneath thy roof but all her cheerless days despairing wastes and all her nights in tears so saying eumæus at his hand received his brazen lance and o er the step of stone 50 enter d telemachus to whom his sire relinquish d soon as he appear d his seat but him telemachus forbidding said  guest keep thy seat our cottage will afford some other which eumæus will provide he ceased and he returning at the word reposed again then good eumæus spread green twigs beneath which cover d with a fleece supplied ulysses  offspring with a seat he next disposed his dishes on the board 60 with relicts charged of yesterday with bread alert he heap d the baskets with rich wine his ivy cup replenish d and a seat took opposite to his illustrious lord ulysses they toward the plenteous feast stretch d forth their hands and hunger now and thirst both satisfied telemachus his speech addressing to their gen rous host began whence is this guest my father how convey d came he to ithaca what country boast 70 the mariners with whom he here arrived for that on foot he found us not is sure to whom eumæus thou didst thus reply i will with truth answer thee o my son  he boasts him sprung from ancestry renown d in spacious crete and hath the cities seen of various lands by fate ordain d to roam ev n now from a thesprotian ship escaped he reach d my cottage but he is thy own i yield him to thee treat him as thou wilt 80 he is thy suppliant and depends on thee then thus telemachus discrete replied thy words eumæus pain my very soul for what security can i afford to any in my house myself am young nor yet of strength sufficient to repel an offer d insult and my mother s mind in doubtful balance hangs if still with me an inmate she shall manage my concerns attentive only to her absent lord 90 and her own good report or shall espouse the noblest of her wooers and the best entitled by the splendour of his gifts but i will give him since i find him lodg d a guest beneath thy roof tunic and cloak sword double-edged and sandals for his feet with convoy to the country of his choice still if it please thee keep him here thy guest and i will send him raiment with supplies of all sorts lest he burthen thee and thine 100 but where the suitors come there shall not he with my consent nor stand exposed to pride and petulance like theirs lest by some sneer they wound him and through him wound also me for little is it that the boldest can against so many numbers will prevail him answer d then ulysses toil-inured oh amiable and good since even i am free to answer thee i will avow my heart within me torn by what i hear 110 of those injurious suitors who the house infest of one noble as thou appear st but say submittest thou to their controul willingly or because the people sway d by some response oracular incline against thee thou hast brothers it may chance slow to assist thee for a brother s aid  is of importance in whatever cause for oh that i had youth as i have will or that renown d ulysses were my sire 120 or that himself might wander home again whereof hope yet remains then might i lose my head that moment by an alien s hand if i would fail ent ring ulysses  gate to be the bane and mischief of them all but if alone to multitudes opposed i should perchance be foiled nobler it were with my own people under my own roof to perish than to witness evermore their unexampled deeds guests shoved aside 130 maidens dragg d forcibly from room to room casks emptied of their rich contents and them indulging glutt nous appetite day by day enormous without measure without end to whom telemachus discrete replied stranger thy questions shall from me receive true answer enmity or hatred none subsists the people and myself between nor have i brothers to accuse whose aid is of importance in whatever cause 140 for jove hath from of old with single heirs our house supplied arcesias none begat except laertes and laertes none except ulysses and ulysses me left here his only one and unenjoy d thence comes it that our palace swarms with foes for all the rulers of the neighbour isles samos dulichium and the forest-crown d zacynthus others also rulers here in craggy ithaca my mother seek 150 in marriage and my household stores consume but neither she those nuptial rites abhorr d refuses absolute nor yet consents to end them they my patrimony waste meantime and will destroy me also soon as i expect but heav n disposes all eumæus haste my father bear with speed news to penelope that i am safe and have arrived from pylus i will wait till thou return and well beware that none 160  hear thee beside for i have many foes to whom eumæus thou didst thus reply it is enough i understand thou speak st to one intelligent but say beside shall i not also as i go inform distress d laertes who while yet he mourn d ulysses only could o ersee the works and dieted among his menials oft as hunger prompted him but now they say since thy departure to the pylian shore 170 he neither eats as he was wont nor drinks nor oversees his hinds but sighing sits and weeping wasted even to the bone him then telemachus answer d discrete hard though it be yet to his tears and sighs him leave we now we cannot what we would for were the ordering of all events referr d to our own choice our first desire should be to see my father s glad return but once thy tidings told wander not thou 180 in quest of him but hither speed again rather request my mother that she send her household s governess without delay privately to him she shall best inform the ancient king that i have safe arrived he said and urged him forth who binding on his sandals to the city bent his way nor went eumæus from his home unmark d by pallas who in semblance of a fair damsel accomplish d in domestic arts 190 approaching to the cottage  entrance stood opposite by ulysses plain discern d but to his son invisible for

and the illustrious hero turn d again into the cottage wonder at that sight seiz d on telemachus askance he look d awe-struck not unsuspicious of a god and in wing d accents eager thus began thou art no longer whom i lately saw nor are thy cloaths nor is thy port the same thou art a god i know and dwell st in heav n 220 oh smile on us that we may yield thee rites acceptable and present thee golden gifts elaborate ah spare us pow r divine to whom ulysses hero toil-inured i am no god why deem st thou me divine i am thy father for whose sake thou lead st a life of woe by violence oppress d so saying he kiss d his son while from his cheeks tears trickled tears till then perforce restrained telemachus for he believed him not 230 his father yet thus wond ring spake again my father said st thou no thou art not he but some divinity beguiles my soul with mock ries to afflict me still the more for never mortal man could so have wrought by his own pow r some interposing god alone could render thee both young and old for old thou wast of late and foully clad but wear st the semblance now of those in heav n to whom ulysses ever-wise replied 240 telemachus it is not well my son that thou should st greet thy father with a face of wild astonishment and stand aghast ulysses save myself none comes be sure such as thou seest after ten thousand woes which i have borne i visit once again  my native country in the twentieth year this wonder athenæan pallas wrought she cloath d me even with what form she would for so she can now poor i seem and old 250 now young again and clad in fresh attire the gods who dwell in yonder heav n with ease dignify or debase a mortal man so saying he sat then threw telemachus his arms around his father s neck and wept desire intense of lamentation seized on both soft murmurs utt ring each indulged his grief more frequent wailing than the bird eagle or hook-nail d vulture from whose nest some swain hath stol n her yet unfeather d young 260 so from their eyelids they big drops distill d of tend rest grief nor had the setting sun cessation of their weeping seen had not telemachus his father thus address d what ship convey d thee to thy native shore my father and what country boast the crew for that on foot thou not arriv dst is sure then thus divine ulysses toil-inured my son i will explicit all relate conducted by phæacia s maritime sons 270 i came a race accustom d to convey strangers who visit them across the deep me o er the billows in a rapid bark borne sleeping on the shores of ithaca they lay d rich gifts they gave

tell me now that i may know 280 how pow rful certainly and who they are and consultation with my dauntless heart may hold if we be able to contend ourselves with all or must have aid beside then answer thus his son discrete return d my father thy renown hath ever rung in thy son s ears and by report thy force in arms and wisdom i have oft been told but terribly thou speak st amazement-fixt  i hear can two a multitude oppose 290 and valiant warriors all for neither ten are they nor twenty but more num rous far learn now their numbers fifty youths and two came from dulichium they are chosen men and six attendants follow in their train from samos twenty youths and four arrive zacynthus also of achaia s sons sends twenty more and our own island adds herself her twelve chief rulers medon too is there the herald and the bard divine 300 with other two intendants of the board should we within the palace we alone assail them all i fear lest thy revenge unpleasant to thyself and deadly prove frustrating thy return but recollect  think if thou canst on whose confed rate arm strenuous on our behalf we may rely to him replied his patient father bold i will inform thee mark weigh well my words will pallas and the everlasting sire 310 alone suffice or need we other aids then answer thus telemachus return d good friends indeed are they whom thou hast named though throned above the clouds for their controul is universal both in earth and heav n to whom ulysses toil-worn chief renown d not long will they from battle stand aloof when once within my palace in the strength of mars to sharp decision we shall urge the suitors but thyself at early dawn 320 our mansion seek that thou may st mingle there with that imperious throng me in due time eumæus to the city shall conduct in form a miserable beggar old but should they with dishonourable scorn insult me thou unmov d my wrongs endure and should they even drag me by the feet abroad or smite me with the spear thy wrath refraining gently counsel them to cease from such extravagance but well i know 330 that cease they will not for their hour is come and mark me well treasure what now i say  deep in thy soul when pallas shall herself suggest the measure then shaking my brows i will admonish thee thou at the sign remove what arms soever in the hall remain and in the upper palace safe dispose them should the suitors missing them perchance interrogate thee then reply gently i have removed them from the smoke 340 for they appear no more the arms which erst ulysses going hence to ilium left but smirch d and sullied by the breath of fire this weightier reason thou shalt also say jove taught me lest intoxicate with wine ye should assault each other in your brawls shaming both feast and courtship for the view itself of arms incites to their abuse yet leave two faulchions for ourselves alone two spears two bucklers which with sudden force 350 impetuous we will seize and jove all-wise their valour shall and pallas steal away this word store also in remembrance deep  if mine in truth thou art and of my blood then of ulysses to his home returned let none hear news from thee no not my sire laertes nor eumæus nor of all the menials any or ev n penelope that thou and i alone may search the drift of our domestic women and may prove 360 our serving-men who honours and reveres and who contemns us both but chiefly thee so gracious and so worthy to be loved him then thus answer d his illustrious son trust me my father thou shalt soon be taught that i am not of drowsy mind obtuse but this i think not likely to avail or thee or me ponder it yet again for tedious were the task farm after farm to visit of those servants proving each 370 and the proud suitors merciless devour meantime thy substance nor abstain from aught learn if thou wilt and i that course myself advise who slights thee of the female train and who is guiltless but i would not try  from house to house the men far better proved hereafter if in truth by signs from heav n inform d thou hast been taught the will of jove thus they conferr d the gallant bark meantime reach d ithaca which from the pylian shore 380 had brought telemachus with all his band within the many-fathom d port arrived his lusty followers haled her far aground then carried thence their arms but to the house of clytius the illustrious gifts convey d next to the royal mansion they dispatch d an herald charg d with tidings to the queen that her telemachus had reach d the cot of good eumæus and the bark had sent home to the city lest the matchless dame 390 should still deplore the absence of her son they then the herald and the swine-herd each bearing like message to his mistress met and at the palace of the godlike chief arriving compass d by the female throng inquisitive the herald thus began thy son o queen is safe ev n now return d then drawing nigh to her eumæus told his message also from her son received and his commission punctually discharged 400 leaving the palace sought his home again grief seized and anguish at those tidings all the suitors issuing forth on the outside of the high wall they sat before the gate when polybus  son eurymachus began my friends his arduous task this voyage deem d by us impossible in our despight telemachus hath atchieved haste launch we forth a sable bark our best which let us man with mariners expert who rowing forth 410 swiftly shall summon our companions home scarce had he said when turning where he sat amphinomus beheld a bark arrived just then in port he saw them furling sail and seated with their oars in hand he laugh d through pleasure at that sight and thus he spake our message may be spared lo they arrive either some god inform d them or they saw  themselves the vessel of telemachus too swiftly passing to be reach d by theirs 420 he spake they rising hasted to the shore alert they drew the sable bark aground and by his servant each his arms dispatch d to his own home then all to council those assembling neither elder of the land nor youth allow d to join them and the rest eupithes  son antinoüs thus bespake ah how the gods have rescued him all day perch d on the airy mountain-top our spies successive watch d and when the sun declined 430 we never slept on shore but all night long till sacred dawn arose plow d the abyss hoping telemachus that we might seize and slay him whom some deity hath led in our despight safe to his home again but frame we yet again means to destroy telemachus ah let not him escape for end of this our task while he survives none shall be found such prudence he displays and wisdom neither are the people now 440 unanimous our friends as heretofore come then prevent him ere he call the greeks to council for he will not long delay but will be angry doubtless and will tell amid them all how we in vain devised his death a deed which they will scarce applaud but will perhaps punish and drive us forth from our own country to a distant land  prevent him therefore quickly in the field slay him or on the road so shall his wealth 450 and his possessions on ourselves devolve which we will share equally but his house shall be the queen s and his whom she shall wed yet if not so inclined ye rather chuse that he should live and occupy entire his patrimony then no longer here assembled let us revel at his cost but let us all with spousal gifts produced from our respective treasures woo the queen leaving her in full freedom to espouse 460 who proffers most and whom the fates ordain  he ceased the assembly silent sat and mute then rose amphinomus amid them all offspring renown d of nisus son himself of king aretias he had thither led the suitor train who from the pleasant isle corn-clad of green dulichium had arrived and by his speech pleased far beyond them all penelope for he was just and wise and thus well-counselling the rest began 470 not i my friends far be the thought from me to slay telemachus it were a deed momentous terrible to slay a prince first therefore let us counsel ask of heav n and if jove s oracle that course approve i will encourage you and will myself be active in his death but if the gods forbid it then by my advice forbear so spake amphinomus whom all approved arising then into ulysses  house 480 they went where each his splendid seat resumed a novel purpose occupied meantime penelope she purposed to appear before her suitors whose design to slay telemachus she had from medon learn d the herald for his ear had caught the sound toward the hall with her attendant train she moved and when most graceful of her sex where sat the suitors she arrived between the columns standing of the stately dome 490 and covering with her white veil s lucid folds her features to antinoüs thus she spake antinoüs proud contentious evermore to mischief prone the people deem thee wise past thy compeers and in all grace of speech pre-eminent but such wast never thou inhuman why is it thy dark design to slay telemachus and why with scorn rejectest thou the suppliant s pray r72 which jove himself hath witness d plots please not the gods 500 know st not that thy own father refuge found here when he fled before the people s wrath  whom he had irritated by a wrong which with a band of taphian robbers joined he offer d to the thesprots our allies they would have torn his heart and would have laid all his delights and his possessions waste but my ulysses slaked the furious heat of their revenge whom thou requitest now wasting his goods soliciting his wife 510 slaying his son and filling me with woe but cease i charge thee and bid cease the rest to whom the son of polybus replied eurymachus icarius  daughter wise take courage fair penelope and chace these fears unreasonable from thy mind the man lives not nor shall who while i live and faculty of sight retain shall harm telemachus thy son for thus i say and thus will i perform his blood shall stream 520 a sable current from my lance s point that moment for the city-waster chief ulysses oft me placing on his knees hath fill d my infant grasp with sav ry food and giv n me ruddy wine i therefore hold telemachus of all men most my friend nor hath he death to fear from hand of ours yet if the gods shall doom him die he must so he encouraged her who yet himself plotted his death she re-ascending sought 530 her stately chamber and arriving there deplored with tears her long-regretted lord till athenæan pallas azure-eyed dews of soft slumber o er her lids diffused and now at even-tide eumæus reach d ulysses and his son a yearling swine just slain they skilfully for food prepared when pallas drawing nigh smote with her wand ulysses at the stroke rend ring him old and his apparel sordid as before 540 lest knowing him the swain at once should seek penelope and let the secret forth then foremost him telemachus address d noble eumæus thou art come what news bring st from the city have the warrior band  of suitors hopeless of their ambush reach d the port again or wait they still for me to whom eumæus thou didst thus reply no time for such enquiry nor to range curious the streets had i but anxious wish d 550 to make my message known and to return but as it chanced a nimble herald sent from thy companions met me on the way who reach d thy mother first yet this i know for this i saw passing above the town where they have piled a way-side hill of stones to mercury i beheld a gallant bark ent ring the port a bark she was of ours the crew were num rous and i mark d her deep- laden with shields and spears of double edge 560 theirs i conjectured her and could no more he spake and by eumæus unperceived telemachus his father eyed and smiled their task accomplish d and the table spread they ate nor any his due portion miss d and hunger now and thirst both sated all to rest repair d and took the gift of sleep   now look d aurora from the east abroad when the illustrious offspring of divine ulysses bound his sandals to his feet he seiz d his sturdy spear match d to his gripe and to the city meditating quick departure now the swine-herd thus bespake father i seek the city to convince my mother of my safe return whose tears i judge and lamentation shall not cease till her own eyes behold me but i lay 10 on thee this charge into the city lead thyself this hapless guest that he may beg provision there a morsel and a drop from such as may perchance vouchsafe the boon i cannot vext and harass d as i am feed all and should the stranger take offence the worse for him plain truth is my delight to whom ulysses ever-wise replied nor is it my desire to be detained better the mendicant in cities seeks 20 his dole vouchsafe it whosoever may than in the villages i am not young nor longer of an age that well accords with rural tasks nor could i all perform that it might please a master to command go then and when i shall have warm d my limbs before the hearth and when the risen sun  shall somewhat chase the cold thy servant s task shall be to guide me thither as thou bidd st for this is a vile garb the frosty air 30 of morning would benumb me thus attired and as ye say the city is remote he ended and telemachus in haste set forth his thoughts all teeming as he went with dire revenge soon in the palace-courts arriving he reclined his spear against a column and proceeded to the hall him euryclea first his nurse perceived while on the variegated seats she spread their fleecy cov ring swift with tearful eyes 40 she flew to him and the whole female train of brave ulysses swarm d around his son clasping him and his forehead and his neck kissing affectionate then came herself as golden venus or diana fair forth from her chamber to her son s embrace the chaste penelope with tears she threw her arms around him his bright-beaming eyes and forehead kiss d and with a murmur d plaint maternal in wing d accents thus began 50 thou hast return d light of my eyes my son my lov d telemachus i had no hope to see thee more when once thou hadst embark d for pylus privily and with no consent from me obtain d news seeking of thy sire but haste unfold declare what thou hast seen to whom telemachus discrete replied ah mother let my sorrows rest nor me from death so lately  scaped afflict anew but bathed and habited in fresh attire 60 with all the maidens of thy train ascend to thy superior chamber there to vow a perfect hecatomb to all the gods when jove shall have avenged our num rous wrongs i seek the forum there to introduce a guest my follower from the pylian shore whom sending forward with my noble band i bade piræus to his own abode lead him and with all kindness entertain the stranger till i should myself arrive 70  he spake nor flew his words useless away she bathed and habited in fresh attire vow d a full hecatomb to all the gods would jove but recompense her num rous wrongs then spear in hand went forth her son two dogs fleet-footed following him o er all his form pallas diffused a dignity divine and ev ry eye gazed on him as he pass d the suitors throng d him round joy on their lips and welcome but deep mischief in their hearts 80 he shunning all that crowd chose to himself a seat where mentor sat and antiphus and halytherses long his father s friends sincere who of his voyage much enquired then drew piræus nigh leading his guest toward the forum nor telemachus stood long aloof but greeted his approach and was accosted by piræus thus sir send thy menial women to bring home the precious charge committed to my care 90 thy gifts at menelaus  hands received to whom telemachus discrete replied piræus wait for i not yet foresee the upshot should these haughty ones effect my death clandestine under my own roof and parcel my inheritance by lot i rather wish those treasures thine than theirs but should i with success plan for them all a bloody death then wing d with joy thyself bring home those presents to thy joyful friend 100 so saying he led the anxious stranger thence into the royal mansion where arrived each cast his mantle on a couch or throne and plung d his feet into a polish d bath there wash d and lubricated with smooth oils from the attendant maidens each received tunic and shaggy mantle thus attired forth from the baths they stepp d and sat again a maiden next with golden ewer charged and silver bowl pour d water on their hands 110 and spread the polish d table which with food of all kinds remnants of the last regale the mistress of the household charge supplied  meantime beside a column of the dome his mother on a couch reclining twirl d her slender threads they to the furnish d board stretch d forth their hands and hunger now and thirst both satisfied penelope began telemachus i will ascend again and will repose me on my woeful bed 120 for such it hath been and with tears of mine ceaseless bedew d e er since ulysses went with atreus  sons to troy for not a word thou would st vouchsafe me till our haughty guests had occupied the house again of all that thou hast heard if aught indeed thou hast of thy long-absent father s wish d return her answer d then telemachus discrete mother at thy request i will with truth relate the whole at pylus shore arrived 130 we nestor found chief of the pylian race receiving me in his august abode he entertain d me with such welcome kind as a glad father shews to his own son long-lost and newly found so nestor me and his illustrious offspring entertain d but yet assured me that he nought had heard from mortal lips of my magnanimous sire whether alive or dead with his own steeds he sent me and with splendid chariot thence 140 to spear-famed menelaus atreus  son there saw i helen by the gods  decree auth ress of trouble both to greece and troy the hero menelaus then enquired what cause had urged me to the pleasant vale of lacedæmon plainly i rehearsed the occasion and the hero thus replied ye gods they are ambitious of the bed of a brave man however base themselves but as it chances when the hart hath laid 150 her fawns new-yean d and sucklings yet to rest in some resistless lion s den she roams meantime the hills and in the grassy vales feeds heedless but the lion to his lair returning soon both her and hers destroys so shall thy father brave ulysses them  jove pallas and apollo oh that such as erst in well-built lesbos where he strove with philomelides whom wrestling flat he threw when all achaia s sons rejoiced 160 ulysses now might mingle with his foes short life and bitter nuptials should be theirs but thy enquiries neither indirect will i evade nor give thee false reply but all that from the ancient of the deep73 i have received will utter hiding nought the god declared that he had seen thy sire in a lone island sorrowing and detain d an inmate in the grotto of the nymph calypso wanting also means by which 170 to reach the country of his birth again for neither gallant barks nor friends had he to speed his passage o er the boundless waves so menelaus spake the spear-renown d my errand thus accomplish d i return d  and by the gods with gales propitious blest was wafted swiftly to my native shore he spake and tumult in his mother s heart so speaking raised consolatory next the godlike theoclymenus began 180 consort revered of laertiades little the spartan knew but list to me for i will plainly prophesy and sure be jove of all in heav n my witness first then this thy hospitable board and last the household gods of the illustrious chief ulysses at whose hearth i have arrived74 that even now within his native isle ulysses somewhere sits or creeps obscure witness of these enormities and seeds 190 sowing of dire destruction for his foes so sure an augury while on the deck reclining of the gallant bark i saw and with loud voice proclaim d it to thy son him answer d then penelope discrete grant heav n my guest that this good word of thine  fail not then shalt thou soon such bounty share and

ulysses ever-wise replied 230 it is enough i understand thou speak st to one intelligent let us depart and lead thyself the way but give me first if thou have one already hewn a staff to lean on for ye have described the road rugged and ofttimes dang rous to the foot so saying his tatter d wallet o er his back he cast suspended by a leathern twist eumæus gratified him with a staff  and forth they

suffer d the affront him then eumæus with indignant look rebuking rais d his hands and fervent pray d nymphs of the fountains progeny of jove 290 if e er ulysses on your altar burn d the thighs of

shepherds mar the flocks to whom the goat-herd answer thus return d melantheus marvellous how rare a speech the subtle cur hath framed whom i will send 300 far hence at a convenient time on board my bark and sell him at no little gain i would that he who bears the silver bow as sure might pierce telemachus this day in his own house or that the suitors might as that same wand rer shall return no more he said and them left pacing slow along but soon himself at his lord s house arrived there ent ring bold he with the suitors sat opposite to eurymachus for him 310 he valued most the sewers his

phemius had begun his song he grasp d the swine-herd s hand and thus he said this house eumæus of ulysses seems passing magnificent and to be known with ease for his among a thousand more 320 one pile supports another and a wall crested with battlements surrounds the court firm too the folding doors all force of man defy but num rous guests as i perceive now feast within witness the sav ry steam  fast-fuming upward and the sounding harp divine associate of the festive board to whom eumæus thou didst thus reply thou hast well-guess d no wonder thou art quick on ev ry theme but let us well

stood argus the while ulysses  dog uplifted where he lay 350 his head and ears erect ulysses him had bred long since himself but rarely used departing first to ilium him the youths in other days led

eumæus beautiful in form he is past doubt but whether he hath been 370 as fleet as fair i know not rather such perchance as masters sometimes keep to grace their tables nourish d more for shew than

afar the heedless servants care not for his dog domestics missing once their lord s controul grow wilful and refuse their proper tasks for whom jove dooms to servitude he takes at once the half of

telemachus long ere the rest marking the swine-herd s entrance with a nod summon d him to approach eumæus cast his eye around and seeing vacant there the seat which the dispenser of the feast was wont to occupy while he supplied the num rous guests planted it right before telemachus and at his table sat 400 on which the herald placed for him his share of meat and from the baskets gave him bread soon after him ulysses enter d slow the palace like a squalid beggar old staff-propp d and in loose tatters foul attired within the portal on the ashen sill he sat and seeming languid lean d against a cypress pillar by the builder s art polish d long since and planted at the door then took telemachus a loaf entire 410 forth from the elegant basket and of flesh  a portion large as his two hands

both hands outspread the mess receiving as he sat on his worn bag disposed it at his feet long as the bard chaunted he ate and when he ceas d to eat 430 then also ceas d the bard divine to sing and now ensued loud clamour in the hall and tumult when minerva drawing nigh to laertiades impell d the chief crusts to collect or any pittance small at ev ry suitor s hand for trial s sake of just and

illustrious queen this guest of whom ye ask i have beheld elsewhere the swine-herd brought him but himself i know not neither who nor whence he is so he then thus antinoüs stern rebuked 450 the swine-herd ah notorious as thou art why hast thou shewn this vagabond the way  into the city are we not enough infested with these troublers of our feasts deem st it a trifle that such numbers eat at thy lord s cost and hast thou therefore led this fellow hither found we know not where to whom eumæus thou didst thus reply antinoüs though of high degree thou speak st not wisely what man to another

guests these and such only are in ev ry land call d to the banquet none invites the poor who much consume and no requital yield but thou of all the suitors roughly treat st ulysses  servants most and chiefly me 470 yet thee i heed not while the virtuous queen dwells in this palace and her godlike son to whom telemachus discrete replied peace answer not verbose a man like him antinoüs hath a tongue accustom d much to tauntings and promotes them in the rest then turning to antinoüs quick he said  antinoüs as a father for his son takes thought so thou for me who bidd st me chase the stranger

famed ulysses ah within thy breast dwells no such thought thou lov st not to impart to others but to gratify thyself to whom antinoüs answer thus return d high-soaring and intemp rate in thy speech how hast thou said telemachus would all 490 as much bestow on him he should not seek admittance here again three months to come so saying he seized the stool which banqueting he press d with his nice feet and from beneath  the table forth advanced it into view the rest all gave to him with bread and flesh filling his wallet and ulysses now returning to his threshold there to taste the bounty of the greeks paused in his way beside antinoüs whom he thus address d 500 kind sir vouchsafe to me for thou appear st not least but greatest of the achaians here and hast a kingly look it might become

introduced this nuisance here  this troubler of our feast stand yonder keep due distance from my table or expect to see an ægypt and a cyprus worse 540 than those bold mendicant and void of shame thou hauntest each and inconsid rate each gives to thee because gifts at other s cost are cheap and plentifully serv d themselves they squander heedless viands not their own to whom ulysses while he slow

raged antinoüs still the more and in wing d accents louring thus replied take such dismission now as thou deserv st opprobrious hast thou dared to scoff at me so saying he seized his stool and on the joint of his right shoulder smote him firm as rock he stood by no such force to be displaced but silent shook his brows and dreadful deeds of vengeance ruminating sought again his seat the threshold where his bag full-charged 560 he grounded and the suitors thus address d hear now ye suitors of the matchless queen my bosom s dictates trivial is the harm scarce felt if fighting for his own his sheep perchance or beeves a man receive a blow but me antinoüs struck for that i ask d food from him merely to appease the pangs of hunger source of num rous ills to man if then the poor man have a

thou didst not well to smite the wretched vagabond o thou art doom d 580  for ever if there be a god in heav n77 for in similitude of strangers oft the gods who can with ease all shapes assume repair to populous cities where they mark the outrageous and the righteous deeds of men so they for whose reproof he little cared but in his heart telemachus that blow resented anguish-torn yet not a tear he shed but silent shook his brows and mused terrible things penelope meantime 590 told of the wand rer so abused beneath her roof among her maidens thus exclaim d so may apollo glorious archer smite thee also then eurynome replied oh might our pray rs prevail none of them all should see bright-charioted aurora more her answer d then penelope discrete nurse they are odious all for that alike all teem with mischief but antinoüs  looks remind me ever of the gloom of death 600 a stranger hath arrived who begging roams the house for so his penury enjoins the rest have giv n him and have fill d his bag with viands but antinoüs hath bruised his shoulder with a foot-stool hurl d at him while thus the queen conversing with her train in her own chamber sat ulysses made plenteous repast then calling to her side eumæus thus she signified her will eumæus noble friend bid now approach 610 yon stranger i would speak with him and ask if he has seen ulysses or have heard tidings perchance of the afflicted chief for much a wand rer by his garb he seems to whom eumæus thou didst thus reply were those achaians silent thou shouldst hear o queen a tale that would console thy heart  three nights i housed him and within my cot three days detain d him for his ship he left a fugitive and came direct to me 620 but half untold his hist ry still remains as when his eye one fixes on a bard from heav n instructed in such themes as charm the ear of mortals ever as he sings the people press insatiable to hear so in my cottage seated at my side that stranger with his tale enchanted me laertes he affirms hath been his guest erewhile in crete where minos  race resides and thence he hath arrived after great loss 630 a suppliant to the very earth abased he adds that in thesprotia s neighbour realm he of ulysses heard both that he lives and that he comes laden with riches home to whom penelope discrete replied haste call him i would hear myself his tale meantime let these or in the palace gate sport jocular or here their hearts are light for their possessions are secure their wine none drinks or eats their viands save their own 640 while my abode day after day themselves haunting my beeves and sheep and fatted goats slay for the banquet and my casks exhaust extravagant whence endless waste ensues for no such friend as was ulysses once have i to expel the mischief but might he revisit once his native shores again then aided by his son he should avenge incontinent the wrongs which now i mourn then sneezed telemachus with sudden force 650 that all the palace rang his mother laugh d and in wing d accents thus the swain bespake haste bid him hither hear st thou not the sneeze propitious of my son oh might it prove a presage of inevitable death to all these revellers may none escape now mark me well should the event his tale confirm at my own hands he shall receive mantle and tunic both for his reward she spake he went and where ulysses sat 660  arriving in wing d

report thy meed shall be a boon which much thou need st tunic and mantle but she gives no more thy sustenance thou must as now obtain78 begging it at their hands who chuse to give 670 then thus ulysses hero toil-inured eumæus readily i can relate truth and truth only to the prudent queen icarius  daughter for of him i know much and have suff red sorrows like his own but dread i feel of this imperious throng perverse whose riot and outrageous acts of violence echo through the vault of heav n and even now when for no fault of mine yon suitor struck me as i pass d and fill d 680 my flesh with pain neither telemachus nor any interposed to stay his arm now therefore let penelope although impatient till the sun descend postpone her questions then she may enquire secure when comes her husband and may nearer place my seat to the hearth-side for thinly clad thou know st i am whose aid i first implored he ceas d at whose reply eumæus sought again the queen but ere he yet had pass d 690 the threshold thus she greeted his return com st thou alone eumæus why delays the invited wand rer dreads he other harm or sees he aught that with a bashful awe fills him the bashful poor are poor indeed to whom eumæus thou didst thus reply he hath well spoken none who would decline the rudeness of this contumelious throng could answer otherwise thee he entreats to wait till sun-set and that course o queen 700 thou shalt thyself far more commodious find  to hold thy conf rence with the guest alone then answer thus penelope return d the stranger i perceive is not unwise whoe er he be for on the earth are none proud insolent and profligate as these so spake the queen then all his message told the good eumæus to the suitors went again and with his head inclined toward telemachus lest others should his words 710 witness in accents wing d him thus address d friend and kind master i return to keep my herds and to attend my rural charge whence we are both sustain d keep thou meantime

mourns her itylus her son by royal zethus whom she erring slew85 so also i by soul-distressing doubts toss d ever muse if i shall here remain a faithful guardian of my son s affairs my husband s bed

mind could never give consent  that i should wed and leave him but at length since he hath reached the stature of a man he wishes my departure hence the waste viewing indignant by the suitors made but i have dream d hear and expound my dream my geese are twenty which within my walls i feed with sodden wheat they serve to amuse sometimes my sorrow from the mountains came an eagle huge hook-beak d brake all their necks 670 and slew them scatter d on the palace-floor they lay and he soar d swift into the skies dream only as it was i wept aloud till all my maidens gather d by my voice arriving found me weeping still and still complaining that the eagle had at once slain all my geese but to the palace-roof stooping again he sat and with a voice of human sound forbad my tears and said  courage o daughter of the far-renown d 680 icarius no vain dream thou hast beheld but in thy sleep a truth the slaughter d geese denote thy suitors i who have appear d an eagle in thy sight am yet indeed thy husband who have now at last return d death horrid death designing for them all he said then waking at the voice i cast an anxious look around and saw my geese beside their tray all feeding as before her then ulysses answer d ever-wise 690 o queen it is not possible to miss thy dream s plain import since ulysses  self hath told thee the event thy suitors all must perish not one suitor shall escape to whom penelope discrete replied dreams are inexplicable o my guest and oft-times mere delusions that receive no just accomplishment there are two gates through which the fleeting phantoms pass of horn is one and one of ivory86 such dreams 700  as through the thin-leaf d iv ry portal come sooth but perform not utt ring empty sounds but such as through the polish d horn escape if haply seen by any mortal eye prove faithful witnesses and are fulfill d but through those gates my wond rous dream i think came not thrice welcome were it else to me and to my son now mark my words attend this is the hated morn that from the house removes me of ulysses i shall fix 710 this day the rings for trial to them all of archership ulysses  custom was to plant twelve spikes all regular arranged87 like galley-props and crested with a ring then standing far remote true in his aim he with his whizzing shaft would thrid them all this is the contest in which now i mean to prove the suitors him who with most ease shall bend the bow and shoot through all the rings i follow this dear mansion of my youth 720 leaving so fair so fill d with ev ry good though still to love it even in my dreams her answer d then ulysses ever-wise consort revered of laertiades postpone not this contention but appoint forthwith the trial for ulysses here will sure arrive ere they his polish d bow

sleep ne er should influence these eyes the while but always to resist sleep s pow r is not for man to whom the gods each circumstance of his condition here fix universally myself will seek my own apartment at the palace-top and there will lay me down on my sad couch for such it hath been and with tears of mine  ceaseless bedew d e er since ulysses went 740 to that bad city never to be named there will i sleep but sleep thou here below either thyself preparing on the ground thy couch or on a couch by these prepared so saying she to her splendid chamber thence retired not sole but by her female train attended there arrived she wept her spouse her lov d ulysses till minerva dropp d the balm of slumber on her weary lids   but in the vestibule the hero lay on a bull s-hide undress d o er which he spread the fleece of many a sheep slain by the greeks and cover d by the household s governess with a wide cloak composed himself to rest yet slept he not but meditating lay woe to his enemies meantime the train of women wonted to the suitors  arms issuing all mirth and laughter in his soul a tempest raised of doubts whether at once 10 to slay or to permit them yet to give their lusty paramours one last embrace as growls the mastiff standing on the start for battle if a stranger s foot approach her cubs new-whelp d so growl d ulysses  heart while wonder fill d him at their impious deeds but smiting on his breast thus he reproved the mutinous inhabitant within heart bear it worse than this thou didst endure when uncontroulable by force of man 20 the cyclops thy illustrious friends devour d thy patience then fail d not till prudence found deliv rance for thee on the brink of fate so disciplined the hero his own heart which tractable endured the rigorous curb

took and thus she spake why sleep st thou not unhappiest of mankind thou art at home here dwells thy wife and here thy son a son whom all might wish their own then her ulysses answer d ever-wise o goddess true is all that thou hast said 40 but not without anxiety i muse how single as i am i shall assail those shameless suitors who frequent my courts daily and always their whole multitude this weightier theme i meditate beside should i with jove s concurrence and with thine prevail to slay them how shall i escape myself at last88 oh goddess weigh it well him answer d then pallas cærulean-eyed oh faithless man a man will in his friend 50 confide though mortal and in valour less and wisdom than himself but i who keep thee in all difficulties am divine i tell thee plainly were

afresh had seized him once to the olympian summit swift return d but his chaste spouse awoke she weeping sat on her soft couch and noblest of her sex satiate at length with tears her pray r address d

for jove the happiness himself appoints and the unhappiness of all below meantime the harpies ravishing away those virgins gave them to the furies three 90 that they might serve them o that me the

both good and ill but me the gods afflict not seldom ev n in dreams and at my side this night again one lay resembling him such as my own ulysses when he join d achaia s warriors my exulting heart no airy dream believed it but a truth while thus she spake in orient gold enthroned came forth the morn ulysses as she wept heard plain her lamentation him that sound 110 alarm d he thought her present and himself  known to her gath ring hastily the cloak his cov ring and the fleeces them he placed together on a throne within the hall but bore the bull s-hide forth into the air then lifting high his hands to jove he pray d eternal sire if over moist and dry ye have with good-will sped me to my home after much suff ring grant me from the lips of some domestic now awake to hear 120 words of propitious omen and thyself vouchsafe me still some other sign abroad such pray r he made and jove omniscient heard sudden he thunder d from the radiant heights olympian glad ulysses heard the sound a woman next a labourer at the mill hard by where all the palace-mills were wrought gave him the omen of propitious sound twelve maidens day by day toil d at the mills meal grinding some of barley some of wheat 130 marrow of man90 the rest their portion ground all slept she only from her task as yet ceas d not for she was feeblest of them all she rested on her mill and thus pronounced the happy omen by her lord desired jove father governor of heav n and earth loud thou hast thunder d from the starry skies by no cloud veil d a sign propitious giv n to whom i know not but oh grant the pray r of a poor bond-woman appoint their feast 140 this day the last that in ulysses  house the suitors shall enjoy for whom i drudge with aching heart and trembling knees their meal grinding continual feast they here no more she ended and the list ning chief received with equal joy both signs for well he hoped that he should punish soon those guilty men and now the other maidens in the hall assembling kindled on the hearth again th  unwearied blaze then godlike from his couch 150 arose telemachus and fresh-attired athwart his shoulders his bright faulchion slung bound his fair sandals to his feet and took  his sturdy spear pointed with glitt ring brass advancing to the portal there he stood and euryclea thus his nurse bespake nurse have ye with respectful notice serv d our guest or hath he found a sordid couch e en where he might for prudent though she be my mother inattentive oft the worse 160 treats kindly and the better sends away whom euryclea answer d thus discrete blame not my son who merits not thy blame the guest sat drinking till he would no more and ate till question d he replied enough but when the hour of sleep call d him to rest she gave commandment to her female train to spread his couch yet he like one forlorn and through despair indiff rent to himself both bed and rugs refused and in the porch 170 on skins of sheep and on an undress d hide reposed where we threw cov ring over him she ceas d and grasping his bright-headed spear forth went the prince attended as he went by his fleet hounds to the assembled greeks in council with majestic gait he moved and euryclea daughter wise of ops pisenor s son call d to the serving-maids haste ye be diligent sweep the palace-floor and sprinkle it then give the sumptuous seats 180 their purple coverings let others cleanse with sponges all the tables wash and rince the beakers well and goblets rich-emboss d run others to the fountain and bring thence water with speed the suitors will not long be absent but will early come to-day for this day is a public festival91 so she whom all obedient heard forth went together twenty to the crystal fount while in their sev ral provinces the rest 190 bestirr d them brisk at home then enter d all the suitors and began cleaving the wood meantime the women from the fountain came whom soon the swine-herd follow d driving three his fattest brawns them in the spacious court  he feeding left and to ulysses  side approaching courteously bespake the chief guest look the greecians on thee with respect at length or still disdainful as before then answer thus ulysses wise return d 200 yes and i would that vengeance from the gods might pay their insolence who in a house not theirs dominion exercise and plan unseemly projects shameless as they are thus they conferr d and now melanthius came the goat-herd driving with the aid of two his fellow-swains the fattest of his goats to feast the suitors in the sounding porch the goats he tied then drawing near in terms reproachful thus assail d ulysses  ear 210 how stranger persever st thou begging still to vex the suitors wilt thou not depart scarce shall we settle this dispute i judge till we have tasted each the other s fist thou art unreasonable thus to beg here always have the greeks no feasts beside he spake to whom ulysses answer none return d but shook his brows and silent framed terrible purposes then third approach d chief o er the herds philœtius fatted goats 220 he for the suitors brought with which he drove an heifer ferry-men had pass d them o er carriers of all who on their coast arrive he tied them in the sounding porch then stood beside the swine-herd to whom thus he said who is this guest eumæus here arrived so lately from what nation hath he come what parentage and country boasts the man i pity him whose figure seems to speak royalty in him heav n will surely plunge 230 the race of common wand rers deep in woe if thus it destine even kings to mourn he ceas d and with his right hand drawing nigh welcom d ulysses whom he thus bespake hail venerable guest and be thy lot prosp rous at least hereafter who art held at present in the bonds of num rous ills thou jupiter of all the gods art most  severe and spar st not to inflict distress even on creatures from thyself derived92 240 i had no sooner mark d thee than my eyes swam and the sweat gush d from me at the thought of dear ulysses for if yet he live and see the sun such tatters i suppose he wears a wand rer among human-kind but if already with the dead he dwell in pluto s drear abode oh then alas for kind ulysses who consign d to me while yet a boy his cephalenian herds and they have now encreas d to such a store 250 innumerable of broad-fronted beeves as only care like mine could have produced these by command of others i transport for their regale who neither heed his son nor tremble at the anger of the gods but long have wish d ardently to divide and share the substance of our absent lord me therefore this thought occupies and haunts my mind not seldom while the heir survives it were no small offence to drive his herds 260 afar and migrate to a foreign land yet here to dwell suff ring oppressive wrongs while i attend another s beeves appears still less supportable and i had fled and i had served some other mighty chief long since for patience fails me to endure my present lot but that i cherish still some hope of my ill-fated lord s return to rid his palace of those lawless guests to whom ulysses ever-wise replied 270 herdsman since neither void of sense thou seem st nor yet dishonest but myself am sure that thou art owner of a mind discrete hear therefore for i swear bold i attest jove and this hospitable board and these the lares93 of the noble chief whose hearth protects me now that ere thy going hence ulysses surely shall have reach d his home and thou shalt see him if thou wilt thyself  slaying the suitors who now lord it here 280 him answer d then the keeper of his beeves oh stranger would but the saturnian king perform that word thou should st be taught thyself eye-witness of it what an arm is mine eumæus also ev ry power of heav n entreated that ulysses might possess his home again thus mutual they conferr d meantime in conf rence close the suitors plann d death for telemachus but while they sat consulting on their left the bird of jove 290 an eagle soar d grasping a tim rous dove then thus amphinomus the rest bespake oh friends our consultation how to slay telemachus will never smoothly run to its effect but let us to the feast so spake amphinomus whose counsel pleased then all into the royal house repaired and on the thrones and couches throwing off their mantles slew the fatted goats the brawns the sheep full-sized and heifer of the herd 300 the roasted entrails first they shared then fill d the beakers and the swine-herd placed the cups philœtius chief intendant of the beeves served all with baskets elegant of bread while all their cups melanthius charged with wine and they assail d at once the ready feast meantime telemachus with forecast shrewd fast by the marble threshold but within the spacious hall his father placed to whom a sordid seat he gave and scanty board 310 a portion of the entrails next he set before him fill d a golden goblet high and thus in presence of them all began there seated now drink as the suitors drink i will myself their biting taunts forbid and violence this edifice is mine not public property my father first possess d it and my right from him descends suitors controul your tongues nor with your hands offend lest contest fierce and war ensue 320 he ceas d they gnawing sat their lips aghast with wonder that telemachus in his speech  such boldness used then spake eupithes  son antinoüs and the assembly thus address d let pass ye greeks the language of the prince harsh as it is and big with threats to us had jove permitted his orations here although thus eloquent ere now had ceased so spake antinoüs whom ulysses  son heard unconcern d and now the heralds came 330 in solemn pomp conducting through the streets a sacred hecatomb when in the grove umbrageous of apollo king shaft-arm d the assembled greecians met the sav ry roast finish d and from the spits withdrawn each shared his portion of the noble feast and such as they enjoy d themselves the attendants placed before ulysses for the hero s son himself telemachus had so enjoined but pallas that they might exasp rate more 340 ulysses suffer d not the suitor chiefs to banquet guiltless of heart-piercing scoffs malign there was a certain suitor named ctesippus born in samos base of mind was he and profligate but in the wealth confiding of his father woo d the wife of long-exiled ulysses from his seat the haughty suitors thus that man address d ye noble suitors i would speak attend the guest is served he hath already shared 350 equal with us nor less the laws demand of hospitality for neither just it were nor decent that a guest received here by telemachus should be denied his portion of the feast come then myself will give to him that he may also give to her who laved him in the bath or else to whatsoever menial here he will so saying he from a basket near at hand heav d an ox-foot and with a vig rous arm 360 hurl d it ulysses gently bow d his head shunning the blow but gratified his just resentment with a broad sardonic smile94 of dread significance he smote the wall  then thus telemachus rebuked the deed ctesippus thou art fortunate the bone struck not the stranger for he shunn d the blow else i had surely thrust my glitt ring lance right through thee then no hymenæal rites of thine should have employ d thy father here 370 but thy funereal no man therefore treat me with indignity within these walls for though of late a child i can discern now and distinguish between good and ill suffice it that we patiently endure to be spectators daily of our sheep slaughter d our bread consumed our stores of wine wasted for what can one to all opposed come then persist no longer in offence and hostile hate of me or if ye wish 380 to slay me pause not it were better far to die and i had rather much be slain than thus to witness your atrocious deeds day after day to see our guests abused with blows insulted and the women dragg d with a licentious violence obscene from side to side of all this fair abode he said and all sat silent till at length thus agelaüs spake diastor s son my friends let none with contradiction thwart 390 and rude reply words rational and just assault no more the stranger nor of all the servants of renown d ulysses here harm any my advice both to the queen and to telemachus shall gentle be may it but please them while the hope survived within your bosoms of the safe return of wise ulysses to his native isle so long good reason was that she should use delay and hold our wooing in suspence 400 for had ulysses come that course had proved wisest and best but that he comes no more appears now manifest thou therefore prince seeking thy mother counsel her to wed the noblest and who offers richest dow r that thou for thy peculiar may st enjoy thy own inheritance in peace and ease  and she departing find another home to whom telemachus discrete replied i swear by jove and by my father s woes 410 who either hath deceased far from his home or lives a wand rer that i interpose no hindrance to her nuptials let her wed who offers most and even whom she will but to dismiss her rudely were a deed unfilial that i dare not god forbid so spake telemachus then pallas struck the suitors with delirium wide they stretch d their jaws with unspontaneous laughter loud their meat dripp d blood tears fill d their eyes and dire presages of approaching woe their hearts 421 then thus the prophet theoclymenus95 ah miserable men what curse is this that takes you now night wraps itself around your faces bodies limbs the palace shakes with peals of groans and oh what floods ye weep i see the walls and arches dappled thick with gore the vestibule is throng d the court on all sides throng d with apparitions grim of slaughter d men sinking into the gloom 430 of erebus the sun is blotted out from heav n and midnight whelms you premature he said they hearing laugh d and thus the son of polybus eurymachus replied this wand rer from a distant shore hath left his wits behind hoa there conduct him hence into the forum since he dreams it night already teach him there that it is day then answer d godlike theoclymenus i have no need eurymachus of guides 440 to lead me hence for i have eyes and ears the use of both my feet and of a mind in no respect irrational or wild these shall conduct me forth for well i know that evil threatens you such too as none shall  scape of all the suitors whose delight is to insult the unoffending guest received beneath this hospitable roof  he said and issuing from the palace sought piræus  house who gladly welcom d him 450 then all the suitors on each other cast a look significant and to provoke telemachus the more fleer d at his guests of whom a youth thus insolent began no living wight telemachus had e er guests such as thine witness we know not who this hungry vagabond whose means of life are none and who hath neither skill nor force to earn them a mere burthen on the ground witness the other also who upstarts 460 a prophet suddenly take my advice i counsel wisely send them both on board some gallant bark to sicily for sale thus shall they somewhat profit thee at last so spake the suitors whom telemachus heard unconcern d and silent look d and look d toward his father watching still the time when he should punish that licentious throng meantime icarius  daughter who had placed her splendid seat opposite heard distinct 470 their taunting speeches they with noisy mirth feasted deliciously for they had slain many a fat victim but a sadder feast than soon the goddess and the warrior chief should furnish for them none shall ever share of which their crimes had furnish d first the cause   minerva now goddess cærulean-eyed prompted icarius  daughter the discrete penelope with bow and rings to prove her suitors in ulysses  courts a game terrible in conclusion to them all first taking in her hand the brazen key well-forged and fitted with an iv ry grasp attended by the women of her train she sought her inmost chamber the recess in which she kept the treasures of her lord 10 his brass his gold and steel elaborate here lay his stubborn bow and quiver fill d with num rous shafts a fatal store that bow he had received and quiver from the hand of godlike iphitus eurytides whom in messenia96 in the house he met of brave orsilochus ulysses came demanding payment of arrearage due from all that land for a messenian fleet had borne from ithaca three hundred sheep 20 with all their shepherds for which cause ere yet adult he voyaged to that distant shore deputed by his sire and by the chiefs of ithaca to make the just demand but iphitus had thither come to seek twelve mares and twelve mule colts which he had lost a search that cost him soon a bloody death for coming to the house of hercules the valiant task-performing son of jove  he perish d there slain by his cruel host 30 who heedless of heav n s wrath and of the rights of his own board first fed then slaughter d him for in his house the mares and colts were hidden he therefore occupied in that concern meeting ulysses there gave him the bow which erst huge eurytus had borne and which himself had from his dying sire received ulysses in return on him bestowed a spear and sword pledges of future love and hospitality but never more 40 they met each other at the friendly board for ere that hour arrived the son of jove slew his own guest the godlike iphitus thus came the bow into ulysses  hands which never in his gallant barks he bore to battle with him though he used it oft in times of peace but left it safely stored at home a dear memorial of his friend soon as divinest of her sex arrived at that same chamber with her foot she press d 50 the oaken threshold bright on which the hand of no mean architect had stretch d the line who had erected also on each side the posts on which the splendid portals hung she loos d the ring and brace then introduced the key and aiming at them from without97 struck back the bolts the portals at that stroke sent forth a tone deep as the pastur d bull s and flew wide open she ascending next the elevated floor on which the chests 60 that held her own fragrant apparel stood with lifted hand aloft took down the bow in its embroider d bow-case safe enclosed then sitting there she lay d it on her knees weeping aloud and drew it from the case thus weeping over it long time she sat till satiate at the last with grief and tears descending by the palace steps she sought again the haughty suitors with the bow  elastic and the quiver in her hand 70 replete with pointed shafts a deadly store her maidens as she went bore after her a coffer fill d with prizes by her lord much brass and steel and when at length she came loveliest of women where the suitors sat between the pillars of the stately dome pausing before her beauteous face she held her lucid veil and by two matrons chaste supported the assembly thus address d ye noble suitors hear who rudely haunt 80 this palace of a chief long absent hence whose substance ye have now long time consumed nor palliative have yet contrived or could save your ambition to make me a bride  attend this game to which i call you forth now suitors prove yourselves with this huge bow of wide-renown d ulysses he who draws easiest the bow and who his arrow sends through twice six rings he takes me to his home and i must leave this mansion of my youth 90 plenteous magnificent which doubtless oft i shall remember even in my dreams so saying she bade eumæus lay the bow before them and the twice six rings of steel he wept received them and obey d nor wept the herdsman less seeing the bow which erst his lord had occupied when at their tears indignant thus antinoüs began ye rural drones whose purblind eyes see not beyond the present hour egregious fools 100 why weeping trouble ye the queen too much before afflicted for her husband lost either partake the banquet silently or else go weep abroad leaving the bow that stubborn test to us for none i judge none here shall bend this polish d bow with ease since in this whole assembly i discern none like ulysses whom myself have seen and recollect though i was then a boy he said but in his heart meantime the hope 110 cherish d that he should bend himself the bow and pass the rings yet was he destin d first  of all that company to taste the steel of brave ulysses  shaft whom in that house he had so oft dishonour d and had urged so oft all others to the like offence amidst them then the sacred might arose of young telemachus who thus began saturnian jove questionless hath deprived me of all reason my own mother fam d 120 for wisdom as she is makes known to all her purpose to abandon this abode and follow a new mate while heedless i trifle and laugh as i were still a child but come ye suitors since the prize is such a woman like to whom none can be found this day in all achaia on the shores of sacred pylus in the cities proud of argos or mycenæ or even here in ithaca or yet within the walls 130 of black epirus and since this yourselves know also wherefore should i speak her praise come then delay not waste not time in vain excuses turn not from the proof but bend the bow that thus the issue may be known i also will myself that task essay and should i bend the bow and pass the rings then shall not my illustrious mother leave her son forlorn forsaking this abode to follow a new spouse while i remain 140 disconsolate although of age to bear successful as my sire the prize away so saying he started from his seat cast off his purple cloak and lay d his sword aside then fix d himself the rings furrowing the earth by line and op ning one long trench for all and stamping close the glebe amazement seized all present seeing with how prompt a skill he executed though untaught his task then hasting to the portal there he stood 150 thrice struggling he essay d to bend the bow and thrice desisted hoping still to draw the bow-string home and shoot through all the rings98  and now the fourth time striving with full force he had prevail d to string it but his sire forbad his eager efforts by a sign then thus the royal youth to all around  gods either i shall prove of little force hereafter and for manly feats unapt or i am yet too young and have not strength 160 to quell the aggressor s contumely but come  for ye have strength surpassing mine try ye the bow and bring this contest to an end he ceas d and set the bow down on the floor reclining it against the shaven pannels smooth that lined the wall the arrow next he placed leaning against the bow s bright-polish d horn and to the seat whence he had ris n return d then thus eupithes  son antinoüs spake my friends come forth successive from the right99 170 where he who ministers the cup begins so spake antinoüs and his counsel pleased then first leiodes œnop s son arose he was their soothsayer and ever sat beside the beaker inmost of them all to him alone of all licentious deeds were odious and with indignation fired he witness d the excesses of the rest he then took foremost up the shaft and bow and station d at the portal strove to bend 180 but bent it not fatiguing first his hands delicate and uncustom d to the toil he ceased and the assembly thus bespake my friends i speed not let another try for many princes shall this bow of life bereave since death more eligible seems far more than loss of her for whom we meet continual here expecting still the prize some suitor haply at this moment hopes that he shall wed whom long he hath desired 190 ulysses  wife penelope let him essay the bow and trial made address his spousal offers to some other fair among the long-stoled princesses of greece  this princess leaving his whose proffer d gifts shall please her most and whom the fates ordain he said and set the bow down on the floor reclining it against the shaven pannels smooth that lined the wall the arrow next he placed leaning against the bow s bright-polish d horn 200 and to the seat whence he had ris n return d then him antinoüs angry thus reproved what word leiodes grating to our ears hath scap d thy lips i hear it with disdain shall this bow fatal prove to many a prince because thou hast thyself too feeble proved to bend it no thou wast not born to bend the unpliant bow or to direct the shaft but here are nobler who shall soon prevail he said and to melanthius gave command 210 the goat-herd hence melanthius kindle fire beside it place with fleeces spread a form of length commodious from within procure a large round cake of suet next with which when we have chafed and suppled the tough bow before the fire we will again essay to bend it and decide the doubtful strife he ended and melanthius kindling fire beside it placed with fleeces spread a form of length commodious next he brought a cake 220 ample and round of suet from within with which they chafed the bow then tried again to bend but bent it not superior strength to theirs that task required yet two the rest in force surpassing made no trial yet antinoüs and eurymachus the brave then went the herdsman and the swine-herd forth together after whom the glorious chief himself the house left also and when all without the court had met with gentle speech 230 ulysses then the faithful pair address d herdsman and thou eumæus shall i keep a certain secret close or shall i speak outright my spirit prompts me and i will what welcome should ulysses at your hands receive arriving suddenly at home some god his guide would ye the suitors aid  or would ye aid ulysses answer true then thus the chief intendant of his herds would jove but grant me my desire to see 240 once more the hero and would some kind pow r restore him i would shew thee soon an arm strenuous to serve him and a dauntless heart eumæus also fervently implored the gods in pray r that they would render back ulysses to his home he then convinced of their unfeigning honesty began behold him i am he myself arrived after long suff rings in the twentieth year i know how welcome to yourselves alone 250 of all my train i come for i have heard none others praying for my safe return i therefore tell you truth should heav n subdue the suitors under me ye shall receive each at my hands a bride with lands and house near to my own and ye shall be thenceforth dear friends and brothers of the prince my son lo also this indisputable proof that ye may know and trust me view it here it is the scar which in parnassus erst 260 where with the sons i hunted of renown d autolycus i from a boar received so saying he stripp d his tatters and unveil d the whole broad scar then soon as they had seen and surely recognized the mark each cast his arms around ulysses wept embraced and press d him to his bosom kissing oft his brows and shoulders who as oft their hands and foreheads kiss d nor had the setting sun beheld them satisfied but that himself 270 ulysses thus admonished them and said cease now from tears lest any coming forth mark and report them to our foes within now to the hall again but one by one not all at once i foremost then yourselves and this shall be the sign full well i know that all

doors and should they hear a groan or other noise made by the princes shut within the hall let none set step abroad but all work silent be the palace-door thy charge my good philœtius key it fast without a moment s pause and fix the brace100 he ended and returning to the hall resumed his seat nor stay d his servants long without but follow d their illustrious lord 290 eurymachus was busily employ d turning the bow and chafing it before the sprightly blaze but after all could find no pow r to bend it disappointment wrung a groan from his proud heart and thus he said alas not only for myself i grieve but grieve for all nor though i mourn the loss of such a bride mourn i that loss alone for lovely greecians may be found no few in ithaca and in the neighbour isles 300 but should we so inferior prove at last to brave ulysses that no force of ours can bend his bow we are for ever shamed to whom antinoüs thus eupithes  son not so as even thou art well-assured thyself eurymachus but phœbus claims this day his own who then on such a day would strive to bend it let it rather rest and should we leave the rings where now they stand i trust that none ent ring ulysses  house 310 will dare displace them cup-bearer attend serve all with wine that first libation made we may religiously lay down the bow command ye too melanthius that he drive hither the fairest goats of all his flocks at dawn of day that burning first the thighs to the ethereal archer we may make new trial and decide at length the strife so spake antinoüs and his counsel pleased the heralds then pour d water on their hands 320 while youths crown d high the goblets which they bore  from right to left distributing to all when each had made libation and had drunk till well sufficed then artful to effect his shrewd designs ulysses thus began hear o ye suitors of the illustrious queen my bosom s dictates but i shall entreat chiefly eurymachus and the godlike youth antinoüs whose advice is wisely giv n tamper no longer with the bow but leave 330 the matter with the gods who shall decide the strife to-morrow fav ring whom they will meantime grant me the polish d bow that i may trial make among you of my force if i retain it still in like degree as erst or whether wand ring and defect of nourishment have worn it all away he said whom they with indignation heard extreme alarm d lest he should bend the bow and sternly thus antinoüs replied 340 desperate vagabond ah wretch deprived of reason utterly art not content esteem st it not distinction proud enough to feast with us the nobles of the land none robs thee of thy share thou witnessest our whole discourse which save thyself alone no needy vagrant is allow d to hear thou art befool d by wine as many have been wide-throated drinkers unrestrain d by rule wine in the mansion of the mighty chief 350 pirithoüs made the valiant centaur mad eurytion at the lapithæan feast101 he drank to drunkenness and being drunk committed great enormities beneath pirithoüs  roof and such as fill d with rage the hero-guests who therefore by his feet dragg d him right through the vestibule amerced of nose and ears and he departed thence provoked to frenzy by that foul disgrace whence war between the human kind arose 360  and the bold centaurs but he first incurred by his ebriety that mulct severe great evil also if thou bend the bow to thee i prophesy for thou shalt find advocate or protector none in all this people but we will dispatch thee hence incontinent on board a sable bark to echetus the scourge of human kind from whom is no escape drink then in peace and contest shun with younger men than thou 370 him answer d then penelope discrete antinoüs neither seemly were the deed nor just to maim or harm whatever guest whom here arrived telemachus receives canst thou expect that should he even prove stronger than ye and bend the massy bow he will conduct me hence to his own home and make me his own bride no such design his heart conceives or hope nor let a dread so vain the mind of any overcloud 380 who banquets here since it dishonours me so she to whom eurymachus reply d offspring of polybus o matchless queen icarius  prudent daughter none suspects that thou wilt wed with him a mate so mean should ill become thee but we fear the tongues of either sex lest some achaian say hereafter one inferior far to us ah how unworthy are they to compare with him whose wife they seek to bend his bow 390 pass d all their pow r yet this poor vagabond arriving from what country none can tell bent it with ease and shot through all the rings so will they speak and so shall we be shamed then answer thus penelope return d no fair report eurymachus attends their names or can who riotous as ye the house dishonour and consume the wealth of such a chief why shame ye thus yourselves the guest is of athletic frame well form d 400 and large of limb he boasts him also sprung from noble ancestry come then consent  give him the bow that we may see the proof  for thus i say and thus will i perform sure as he bends it and apollo gives to him that glory tunic fair and cloak shall be his meed from me a javelin keen to guard him against men and dogs a sword of double edge and sandals for his feet and i will send him whither most he would 410 her answer d then prudent telemachus mother the bow is mine and save myself no greek hath right to give it or refuse none who in rock-bound ithaca possess dominion none in the steed-pastured isles of elis if i chose to make the bow his own for ever should that choice controul but thou into the house repairing ply spindle and loom thy province and enjoin diligence to thy maidens for the bow 420 is man s concern alone and shall be mine especially since i am master here she heard astonish d and the prudent speech reposing of her son deep in her heart withdrew then mounting with her female train to her superior chamber there she wept her lost ulysses till minerva bathed with balmy dews of sleep her weary lids and now the noble swine-herd bore the bow toward ulysses but with one voice all 430 the suitors clamorous reproved the deed of whom a youth thus insolent exclaim d thou clumsy swine-herd whither bear st the bow delirious wretch the hounds that thou hast train d shall eat thee at thy solitary home ere long let but apollo prove at last propitious to us and the pow rs of heav n so they whom hearing he replaced the bow where erst it stood terrified at the sound of such loud menaces on the other side 440 telemachus as loud assail d his ear friend forward with the bow or soon repent that thou obey dst the many i will else with huge stones drive thee younger as i am back to the field my strength surpasses thine i would to heav n that i in force excell d  as far and prowess every suitor here so would i soon give rude dismission hence to some who live but to imagine harm he ceased whose words the suitors laughing heard 450 and for their sake in part their wrath resign d against telemachus then through the hall eumæus bore and to ulysses  hand consign d the bow next summoning abroad the ancient nurse he gave her thus in charge it is the pleasure of telemachus sage euryclea that thou key secure the doors and should you hear perchance a groan or other noise made by the princes shut within the hall let none look curious forth 460 but each in quietness pursue her work so he nor flew his words useless away but she incontinent shut fast the doors then noiseless sprang philœtius forth who closed the portals also of the palace-court a ship-rope of ægyptian reed it chanced lay in the vestibule with that he braced the doors securely and re-entring fill d again his seat but watchful eyed his lord he now assaying with his hand the bow 470 made curious trial of it ev ry way and turn d it on all sides lest haply worms had in its master s absence drill d the horn then thus a suitor to his next remark d he hath an eye methinks exactly skill d in bows and steals them or perhaps at home hath such himself or feels a strong desire to make them so inquisitive the rogue adept in mischief shifts it to and fro to whom another insolent replied 480 i wish him like prosperity in all his efforts as attends his effort made on this same bow which he shall never bend so they but when the wary hero wise had made his hand familiar with the bow poising it and examining at once  as when in harp and song adept a bard unlab ring strains the chord to a new lyre the twisted entrails of a sheep below  with fingers nice inserting and above 490 with such facility ulysses bent his own huge bow and with his right hand play d the nerve which in its quick vibration sang clear as the swallow s voice keen anguish seized the suitors wan grew ev ry cheek and jove gave him his rolling thunder for a sign that omen granted to him by the son of wily saturn with delight he heard he took a shaft that at the table-side lay ready drawn but in his quiver s womb 500 the rest yet slept by those achaians proud to be ere long experienced true he lodg d the arrow on the centre of the bow and occupying still his seat drew home nerve and notch d arrow-head with stedfast sight he aimed and sent it right through all the rings from first to last the steel-charged weapon flew issuing beyond and to his son he spake thou need st not blush young prince to have received a guest like me neither my arrow swerved 510 nor labour d i long time to draw the bow my strength is unimpair d not such as these in scorn affirm it but the waning day calls us to supper after which succeeds102 jocund variety the song the harp with all that heightens and adorns the feast he said and with his brows gave him the sign at once the son of the illustrious chief slung his keen faulchion grasp d his spear and stood arm d bright for battle at his father s side 520   then girding up his rags ulysses sprang with bow and full-charged quiver to the door loose on the broad stone at his feet he pour d his arrows and the suitors thus bespake this prize though difficult hath been atchieved now for another mark which never man struck yet but i will strike it if i may and if apollo make that glory mine he said and at antinoüs aimed direct a bitter shaft he purposing to drink 10 both hands advanced toward the golden cup twin-ear d nor aught suspected death so nigh for who at the full banquet could suspect that any single guest however brave should plan his death and execute the blow yet him ulysses with an arrow pierced full in the throat and through his neck behind started the glitt ring point aslant he droop d down fell the goblet through his nostrils flew the spouted blood and spurning with his foot 20 the board he spread his viands in the dust confusion when they saw antinoüs fall n seized all the suitors from the thrones they sprang flew ev ry way and on all sides explored the palace-walls but neither sturdy lance as erst nor buckler could they there discern then furious to ulysses thus they spake thy arrow stranger was ill-aimed a man is no just mark thou never shalt dispute prize more inevitable death is thine 30 for thou hast slain a prince noblest of all  in ithaca and shalt be vultures  food various their judgments were but none believed that he had slain him wittingly nor saw th  infatuate men fate hov ring o er them all then thus ulysses louring dark replied o dogs not fearing aught my safe return from ilium ye have shorn my substance close lain with my women forcibly and sought while yet i lived to make my consort yours 40 heedless of the inhabitants of heav n alike and of the just revenge of man but death is on the wing death for you all he said their cheeks all faded at the sound and each with sharpen d eyes search d ev ry nook for an escape from his impending doom till thus alone eurymachus replied if thou indeed art he the mighty chief of ithaca return d thou hast rehears d with truth the crimes committed by the greeks 50 frequent both in thy house and in thy field but he already who was cause of all lies slain antinoüs he thy palace fill d with outrage not solicitous so much to win the fair penelope but thoughts far diff rent framing which saturnian jove hath baffled all to rule himself supreme in noble ithaca when he had kill d by an insidious stratagem thy son but he is slain now therefore spare thy own 60 thy people public reparation due shall sure be thine and to appease thy wrath for all the waste that eating drinking here we have committed we will yield thee each full twenty beeves gold paying thee beside and brass till joy shall fill thee at the sight however just thine anger was before to whom ulysses frowning stern replied eurymachus would ye contribute each his whole inheritance and other sums 70 still add beside ye should not even so these hands of mine bribe to abstain from blood till ev ry suitor suffer for his wrong ye have your choice fight with me or escape  whoever may the terrours of his fate but ye all perish if my thought be true he ended they with trembling knees and hearts all heard whom thus eurymachus address d to your defence my friends for respite none will he to his victorious hands afford 80 but arm d with bow and quiver will dispatch shafts from the door till he have slain us all therefore to arms draw each his sword oppose the tables to his shafts and all at once rush on him that dislodging him at least from portal and from threshold we may give the city on all sides a loud alarm so shall this archer soon have shot his last thus saying he drew his brazen faulchion keen of double edge and with a dreadful cry 90 sprang on him but ulysses with a shaft in that same moment through his bosom driv n transfix d his liver and down dropp d his sword he staggering around his table fell convolv d in agonies and overturn d both food and wine his forehead smote the floor woe fill d his heart and spurning with his heels his vacant seat he shook it till he died then with his faulchion drawn amphinomus advanced to drive ulysses from the door 100 and fierce was his assault but from behind telemachus between his shoulders fix d a brazen lance and urged it through his breast full on his front with hideous sound he fell leaving the weapon planted in his spine back flew telemachus lest had he stood drawing it forth some enemy perchance should either pierce him with a sudden thrust oblique or hew him with a downright edge swift therefore to his father s side he ran 110 whom reaching in wing d accents thus he said my father i will now bring thee a shield an helmet and two spears i will enclose myself in armour also and will give both to the herdsmen and eumæus arms expedient now and needful for us all to whom ulysses ever-wise replied  run fetch them while i yet have arrows left lest single i be justled from the door he said and at his word forth went the prince 120 seeking the chamber where he had secured the armour thence he took four shields eight spears with four hair-crested helmets charged with which he hasted to his father s side again and arming first himself furnish d with arms his two attendants then all clad alike in splendid brass beside the dauntless chief ulysses his auxiliars firm they stood he while a single arrow unemploy d lay at his foot right-aiming ever pierced 130 some suitor through and heaps on heaps they fell but when his arrows fail d the royal chief his bow reclining at the portal s side against the palace-wall he slung himself a four-fold buckler on his arm he fix d a casque whose crest wav d awful o er his brows on his illustrious head and fill d his gripe with two stout spears well-headed both with brass there was a certain postern in the wall103 at the gate-side the customary pass 140 into a narrow street but barr d secure ulysses bade his faithful swine-herd watch that egress station d near it for it own d one sole approach then agelaüs loud exhorting all the suitors thus exclaim d oh friends will none ascending to the door of yonder postern summon to our aid the populace and spread a wide alarm so shall this archer soon have shot his last to whom the keeper of the goats replied 150 melanthius agelaüs prince renown d that may not be the postern and the gate104 neighbour too near each other and to force the narrow egress were a vain attempt  one valiant man might thence repulse us all but come myself will furnish you with arms fetch d from above for there as i suppose and not elsewhere ulysses and his son have hidden them and there they shall be found so spake melanthius and ascending sought 160 ulysses  chambers through the winding stairs and gall ries of the house twelve bucklers thence he took as many spears and helmets bright as many shagg d with hair then swift return d and gave them to his friends trembled the heart of brave ulysses and his knees at sight of his opposers putting armour on and shaking each his spear arduous indeed now seem d his task and in wing d accents brief thus to his son telemachus he spake 170 either some woman of our train contrives hard battle for us furnishing with arms the suitors or melanthius arms them all him answer d then telemachus discrete father this fault was mine and be it charged on none beside i left the chamber-door unbarr d which more attentive than myself their spy perceived but haste eumæus shut the chamber-door observing well the while if any women of our train have done 180 this deed or whether as i more suspect melanthius dolius  son have giv n them arms thus mutual they conferr d meantime again melanthius to the chamber flew in quest of other arms eumæus as he went mark d him and to ulysses  thus he spake laertes  noble son for wiles renown d behold the traytor whom ourselves supposed seeks yet again the chamber tell me plain shall i should i superior prove in force 190 slay him or shall i drag him thence to thee that he may suffer at thy hands the doom due to his treasons perpetrated oft against thee here even in thy own house then answer thus ulysses shrewd return d i with telemachus will here immew the lordly suitors close rage as they may  ye two the while bind fast melanthius  hands and feet behind his back then cast him bound into the chamber and the door secured 200 pass underneath his arms a double chain and by a pillar s top weigh him aloft till he approach the rafters there to endure living long time the mis ries he hath earned he spake they prompt obey d together both they sought the chamber whom the wretch within heard not exploring ev ry nook for arms they watching stood the door from which at length forth came melanthius bearing in one hand a casque and in the other a broad shield 210 time-worn and chapp d with drought which in his youth warlike laertes had been wont to bear long time neglected it had lain till age had loosed the sutures of its bands at once both springing on him seized and drew him in forcibly by his locks then cast him down prone on the pavement trembling at his fate with painful stricture of the cord his hands they bound and feet together at his back as their illustrious master had enjoined 220 then weigh d him with a double chain aloft by a tall pillar to the palace-roof and thus deriding him eumæus spake now good melanthius on that fleecy bed reclined as well befits thee thou wilt watch all night nor when the golden dawn forsakes the ocean stream will she escape thine eye but thou wilt duly to the palace drive the fattest goats a banquet for thy friends so saying he left him in his dreadful sling 230 then arming both and barring fast the door they sought brave laertiades again and now courageous at the portal stood those four by numbers in the interior house opposed of adversaries fierce in arms when pallas in the form and with the voice approach d of mentor whom laertes  son beheld and joyful at the sight exclaim d help mentor help now recollect a friend and benefactor born when thou wast born 240  so he not unsuspicious that he saw pallas the heroine of heav n meantime the suitors fill d with menaces the dome and agelaüs first damastor s son in accents harsh rebuked the goddess thus beware oh mentor that he lure thee not to oppose the suitors and to aid himself for thus will we ulysses and his son both slain in vengeance of thy purpos d deeds against us we will slay thee next and thou 250 with thy own head shalt satisfy the wrong your force thus quell d in battle all thy wealth whether in house or field mingled with his we will confiscate neither will we leave or son of thine or daughter in thy house alive nor shall thy virtuous consort more within the walls of ithaca be seen he ended and his words with wrath inflamed minerva s heart the more incensed she turn d towards ulysses whom she thus reproved 260 thou neither own st the courage nor the force ulysses now which nine whole years thou showd st at ilium waging battle obstinate for high-born helen and in horrid

mark my deeds and thou shalt own mentor alcimides 270 a valiant friend and mindful of thy love she spake nor made she victory as yet entire his own proving the valour first both of the sire and of his glorious son but springing in a swallow s form aloft perch d on a rafter of the splendid roof then agelaüs animated loud the suitors whom eurynomus also roused amphimedon and demoptolemus and polyctorides pisander named 280 and polybus the brave for noblest far of all the suitor-chiefs who now survived and fought for life were these the bow had quell d  and shafts in quick succession sent the rest then agelaüs thus harangued them all we soon shall tame o friends this warrior s might whom mentor after all his airy vaunts hath left and at the portal now remain themselves alone dismiss not therefore all your spears together but with six alone 290 assail them first jove willing we shall pierce ulysses and subduing him shall slay with ease the rest their force is safely scorn d he ceas d and as he bade six hurl d the spear together but minerva gave them all a devious flight one struck a column one the planks of the broad portal and a third105 flung right his ashen beam pond rous with brass against the wall then ev ry suitor s spear eluded thus ulysses gave the word  300 now friends i counsel you that ye dismiss your spears at them who not content with past enormities thirst also for our blood he said and with unerring aim all threw their glitt ring spears ulysses on the ground stretch d demoptolemus euryades fell by telemachus the swine-herd slew el[a]tus and the keeper of the beeves pisander in one moment all alike lay grinding with their teeth the dusty floor 310 back flew the suitors to the farthest wall on whom those valiant four advancing each recover d quick his weapon from the dead then hurl d the desp rate suitors yet again their glitt ring spears but pallas gave to each a frustrate course one struck a column one the planks of the broad portal and a third flung full his ashen beam against the wall yet pierced amphimedon the prince s wrist but slightly a skin-wound and o er his shield 320 ctesippus reach d the shoulder of the good eumæus but his glancing weapon swift o erflew the mark and fell and now the four ulysses dauntless hero and his friends  all hurl d their spears together in return himself ulysses city-waster chief wounded eurydamas ulysses  son amphimedon the swine-herd polybus and in his breast the keeper of the beeves ctesippus glorying over whom he cried 330 oh son of polytherses whose delight hath been to taunt and jeer never again boast foolishly but to the gods commit thy tongue since they are mightier far than thou take this a compensation for thy pledge of hospitality the huge ox-hoof which while he roam d the palace begging alms ulysses at thy bounteous hand received so gloried he then grasping still his spear ulysses pierced damastor s son and next 340 telemachus enforcing his long beam sheer through his bowels and his back transpierced leiocritus he prostrate smote the floor then pallas from the lofty roof held forth her host-confounding ægis o er their heads with ring their souls with fear they through the hall fled scatter d as an herd which rapid-wing d the gad-fly dissipates infester fell of beeves when vernal suns shine hot and long but as when bow-beak d vultures crooked-claw d106 350 stoop from the mountains on the smaller fowl terrified at the toils that spread the plain the flocks take wing they darting from above strike seize and slay resistance or escape is none the fowler s heart leaps with delight so they pursuing through the spacious hall the suitors smote them on all sides their heads sounded beneath the sword with hideous groans the palace rang and the floor foamed with blood then flew leiodes to ulysses  knees 360 which clasping in wing d accents thus he cried  i clasp thy knees ulysses oh respect my suit and spare me never have i word injurious spoken or injurious deed attempted  gainst the women of thy house but others so transgressing oft forbad yet they abstain d not and a dreadful fate due to their wickedness have therefore found but i their soothsayer alone must fall though unoffending such is the return 370 by mortals made for benefits received to whom ulysses louring dark replied is that thy boast hast thou indeed for these the seer s high office fill d then doubtless oft thy pray r hath been that distant far might prove the day delectable of my return and that my consort might thy own become to bear thee children wherefore thee i doom to a dire death which thou shalt not avoid so saying he caught the faulchion from the floor 380 which agelaüs had let fall and smote leiodes while he kneel d athwart his neck so suddenly that ere his tongue had ceased to plead for life his head was in the dust but phemius son of terpius bard divine who through compulsion with his song regaled the suitors a like dreadful death escaped fast by the postern harp in hand he stood doubtful if issuing he should take his seat beside the altar of hercæan jove107 390 where oft ulysses offer d and his sire fat thighs of beeves or whether he should haste an earnest suppliant to embrace his knees that course at length most pleased him then between the beaker and an argent-studded throne he grounded his sweet lyre and seizing fast the hero s knees him suppliant thus address d i clasp thy knees ulysses oh respect my suit and spare me thou shalt not escape regret thyself hereafter if thou slay 400 me charmer of the woes of gods and men self-taught am i and treasure in my mind  themes of all argument from heav n inspired and i can sing to thee as to a god ah then behead me not put ev n the wish far from thee for thy own beloved son can witness that not drawn by choice or driv n by stress of want resorting to thine house i have regaled these revellers so oft but under force of mightier far than i 410 so he whose words soon as the sacred might heard of telemachus approaching quick his father thus humane he interposed hold harm not with the vengeful faulchion s edge this blameless man and we will also spare medon the herald who hath ever been a watchful guardian of my boyish years unless philœtius have already slain him or else eumæus or thyself perchance unconscious in the tumult of our foes 420 he spake whom medon hearing for he lay beneath a throne and in a new-stript hide enfolded trembling with the dread of death sprang from his hiding-place and casting off the skin flew to telemachus embraced his knees and in wing d accents thus exclaim d prince i am here oh pity me repress thine own and pacify thy father s wrath that he destroy not me through fierce revenge of their iniquities who have consumed 430 his wealth and in their folly scorn d his son to whom ulysses ever-wise replied smiling complacent fear not my own son hath pleaded for thee therefore taught thyself that truth teach others the superior worth of benefits with injuries compared but go ye forth thou and the sacred bard that ye may sit distant in yonder court from all this carnage while i give command myself concerning it to those within 440 he ceas d they going forth took each his seat beside jove s altar but with careful looks suspicious dreading without cease the sword meantime ulysses search d his hall in quest of living foes if any still survived  unpunish d but he found them all alike welt ring in dust and blood num rous they lay like fishes when they strew the sinuous shore of ocean from the grey gulph drawn aground in nets of many a mesh they on the sands 450 lie spread athirst for the salt wave till hot the gazing sun dries all their life away so lay the suitors heap d and thus at length the prudent chief gave order to his son telemachus bid euryclea come quickly the nurse to whom i would impart the purpose which now occupies me most he said obedient to his sire the prince smote on the door and summon d loud the nurse arise thou ancient governess of all 460 our female menials and come forth attend my father he hath somewhat for thine ear so he nor flew his words useless away for throwing wide the portal forth she came and by telemachus conducted found ere long ulysses amid all the slain with blood defiled and dust dread he appear d as from the pastur d ox newly-devoured the lion stalking back his ample chest with gory drops and his broad cheeks are hung 470 tremendous spectacle such seem d the chief blood-stain d all over she the carnage spread on all sides seeing and the pools of blood felt impulse forcible to publish loud that wond rous triumph but her lord repress d the shout of rapture ere it burst abroad and in wing d accents thus his will enforced silent exult o ancient matron dear shout not be still unholy is the voice of loud thanksgiving over slaughter d men 480 their own atrocious deeds and the gods  will have slain all these for whether noble guest arrived or base they scoff d at all alike and for their wickedness have therefore died but say of my domestic women who have scorn d me and whom find st thou innocent to whom good euryclea thus replied my son i will declare the truth thou keep st  female domestics fifty in thy house whom we have made intelligent to comb 490 the fleece and to perform whatever task of these twice six have overpass d the bounds of modesty respecting neither me nor yet the queen and thy own son adult so lately no permission had from her to regulate the women of her train but i am gone i fly with what hath pass d to the queen s ear who nought suspects so sound she sleeps by some divinity composed then answer thus ulysses wise returned 500 hush and disturb her not go summon first those wantons who have long deserved to die he ceas d then issued forth the ancient dame to summon those bad women and meantime calling his son philœtius and eumæus ulysses in wing d accents thus began bestir ye and remove the dead command those women also to your help then cleanse with bibulous sponges and with water all the seats and tables when ye shall have thus 510 set all in order lead those women forth and in the centre of the spacious court between the scull ry and the outer-wall smite them with your broad faulchions till they lose in death the mem ry of their secret loves indulged with wretches lawless as themselves he ended and the damsels came at once all forth lamenting and with tepid tears show ring the ground with mutual labour first bearing the bodies forth into the court 520 they lodged them in the portico meantime ulysses stern enjoin d them haste and urged by sad necessity they bore all out with sponges and with water next they cleansed the thrones and tables while telemachus beesom d the floor eumæus in that work aiding him and the keeper of the beeves and those twelve damsels bearing forth the soil thus order giv n to all within they next led forth the women whom they shut between 530 the scull ry and the outer-wall in close  durance from which no pris ner could escape and thus telemachus discrete began an honourable death is not for these by my advice who have so often heap d reproach on mine and on my mother s head and held lewd commerce with the suitor-train he said and noosing a strong galley-rope to an huge column led the cord around the spacious dome suspended so aloft 540 that none with quiv ring feet might reach the floor as when a flight of doves ent ring the copse or broad-wing d thrushes strike against the net within ill rest entangled there they find so they suspended by the neck expired all in one line together death abhorr d with restless feet awhile they beat the air then ceas d and now through vestibule and hall they led melanthius forth with ruthless steel they pared away his ears and nose pluck d forth 550 his parts of shame destin d to feed the dogs and still indignant lopp d his hands and feet then laving each his feet and hands they sought again ulysses all their work was done and thus the chief to euryclea spake bring blast-averting sulphur nurse bring fire that i may fumigate my walls then bid penelope with her attendants down and summon all the women of her train but euryclea thus his nurse replied 560 my son thou hast well said yet will i first serve thee with vest and mantle stand not here in thy own palace cloath d with tatters foul and beggarly she will abhor the sight then answer thus ulysses wise return d not so bring fire for fumigation first he said nor euryclea his lov d nurse longer delay d but sulphur brought and fire when he with purifying steams himself visited ev ry part the banquet-room 570 the vestibule the court ranging meantime his house magnificent the matron call d the women to attend their lord in haste and they attended bearing each a torch  then gather d they around him all sincere welcoming his return with close embrace enfolding him each kiss d his brows and each his shoulders and his hands lock d fast in

dearest nurse sagacious as thou art thou little know st to scan the counsels wise of the eternal gods but let us seek my son however that i may behold the suitors dead and him by whom they died so saying she left her chamber musing much in her descent whether to interrogate her lord apart or whether to imprint at once his hands with kisses and his brows o erpassing light the portal-step of stone 100 she enter d he sat opposite illumed by the hearth s sprightly blaze and close before a pillar of the dome waiting with eyes downcast till viewing him his noble spouse should speak to him but she sat silent long her faculties in mute amazement held by turns she riveted her eyes on his and seeing him so foul attired by turns she recognized him not then spake her son telemachus and her

the noblest princes far 140 of ithaca on whom our city most depended therefore i advise thee think him prudent then answer d telemachus be that thy care my father for report proclaims thee shrewdest of mankind with whom in ingenuity may none compare lead thou to follow thee shall be our part with prompt alacrity nor shall i judge courage be wanting to our utmost force thus then replied ulysses ever-wise 150 to me the safest counsel and the best seems this first wash yourselves and put ye on your tunics bid ye next the maidens take their best attire and let the bard divine harping melodious play a sportive dance that whether passenger or neighbour near all may imagine nuptials held within so shall not loud report that we have slain all those alarm the city till we gain  our woods and

that order grates my ear who hath displaced my bed the task were hard e en to an artist other than a god none might with ease remove it as for man it might defy the stoutest in his prime of youth to heave it to a different spot for in that bed elaborate a sign 220 a special sign consists i was myself the artificer i fashion d it alone within the court a leafy olive grew lofty luxuriant

but heav n incited her to that offence who never else had even in her thought harbour d the foul enormity from which originated even our distress but now since evident thou hast described our bed which never mortal yet beheld ourselves except and actoris my own attendant giv n me when i left my home by good icarius and who kept the door 270 though hard to be convinced at last i yield so saying

minerva check d night s almost finish d course and held meantime the golden dawn close pris ner in the deep forbidding her to lead her coursers forth lampus and phaëton that furnish light 290 to all

hast spoken from the seer of thebes of arduous toils yet unperform d declare what toils thou wilt disclose them as i judge hereafter and why not disclose them now to whom ulysses ever-wise replied 310 ah conversant with woe why would st thou learn that tale but i will tell it thee at large thou wilt not hear with joy nor shall myself with joy rehearse it for he bade me seek city after city bearing

ranged in order due took each his share then ancient dolius and with him his sons arrived toil-worn by the sicilian dame summon d their cat ress and their father s kind attendant ever in his eve of life they seeing and recalling soon to mind ulysses in the middle mansion stood wond ring when thus ulysses with a voice 460 of some reproof but gentle them bespake old servant sit and eat banishing fear and mute amazement for although provoked by appetite we have long time abstain d expecting ev ry moment thy return he said then dolius with expanded arms sprang right toward ulysses seized his hand kiss d it and in wing d accents thus replied oh master ever dear since thee the gods themselves in answer to our warm desires 470 have unexpectedly at length restored hail and be happy and heav n make thee such but say and truly knows the prudent queen already thy return or shall we send ourselves an herald with the joyful news to whom ulysses ever-wise replied my ancient friend thou may st release thy mind from that solicitude she knows it well so he then dolius to his glossy seat return d and all his sons gath ring around 480 ulysses welcom d him and grasp d his hand then sat beside their father thus beneath laertes  roof they joyful took repast but fame with rapid haste the city roam d in ev ry part promulging in all ears the suitors  horrid fate no sooner heard the multitude that tale than one and all groaning they met and murmuring before ulysses  gates bringing the bodies forth they buried each his friend but gave the dead 490 of other cities to be ferried home by fishermen on board their rapid barks all hasted then to council sorrow wrung their hearts and the assembly now convened arising first eupithes spake for grief  sat heavy on his soul grief for the loss of his antinoüs by ulysses slain foremost of all whom mourning thus he said my friends no trivial fruits the greecians reap of this man s doings those he took with him 500 on board his barks a num rous train and bold then lost his barks lost all his num rous train and these our noblest slew at his return come therefore ere he yet escape by flight to pylus or to noble elis realm of the epeans follow him else shame attends us and indelible reproach if we avenge not on these men the blood of our own sons and brothers farewell then all that makes life desirable my wish 510 henceforth shall be to mingle with the shades oh then pursue and seize them ere they fly thus he with tears and pity moved in all then medon and the sacred bard whom sleep had lately left arriving from the house of laertiades approach d amid the throng they stood all wonder d seeing them and medon prudent senior thus began hear me my countrymen ulysses plann d with no disapprobation of the gods 520 the deed that ye deplore i saw myself a pow r immortal at the hero s side in semblance just of mentor now the god in front apparent led him on and now from side to side of all the palace urged to flight the suitors heaps on heaps they fell he said then terrour wan seiz d ev ry cheek and halitherses hero old the son of mastor who alone among them all knew past and future prudent thus began 530 now o ye men of ithaca my words attentive hear by your own fault my friends this deed hath been perform d for when myself and noble mentor counsell d you to check the sin and folly of your sons ye would not great was their wickedness and flagrant wrong they wrought the wealth devouring and the wife dishonouring of an illustrious chief  whom they deem d destined never to return but hear my counsel go not lest ye draw 540 disaster down and woe on your own heads he ended then with boist rous roar although part kept their seats upsprang the multitude for halitherses pleased them not they chose eupithes  counsel rather all at once to arms they flew and clad in dazzling brass before the city form d their dense array leader infatuate at their head appear d eupithes hoping to avenge his son antinoüs but was himself ordain d 550 to meet his doom and to return no more then thus minerva to saturnian jove oh father son of saturn jove supreme declare the purpose hidden in thy breast wilt thou that this hostility proceed or wilt thou grant them amity again to whom the cloud-assembler god replied why asks my daughter didst thou not design thyself that brave ulysses coming home should slay those profligates act as thou wilt 560 but thus i counsel since the noble chief hath slain the suitors now let peace ensue oath-bound and reign ulysses evermore the slaughter of their brethren and their sons to strike from their remembrance shall be ours let mutual amity as at the first unite them and let wealth and peace abound so saying he animated to her task minerva prompt before and from the heights olympian down to ithaca she flew 570 meantime ulysses for their hunger now and thirst were sated thus address d his hinds look ye abroad lest haply they approach he said and at his word forth went a son of dolius at the gate he stood and thence beholding all that multitude at hand in accents wing d thus to ulysses spake they come they are already arrived arm all then all arising put their armour on ulysses with his three and the six sons 580 of dolius dolius also with the rest  arm d and laertes although silver-hair d warriors perforce when all were clad alike in radiant armour throwing wide the gates they sallied and ulysses led the way then jove s own daughter pallas in the form and with the voice of mentor came in view whom seeing laertiades rejoiced and thus telemachus his son bespake now oh my son thou shalt observe untold 590 by me where fight the bravest oh shame not thine ancestry who have in all the earth proof given of valour in all ages past to whom telemachus discrete replied my father if thou wish that spectacle thou shalt behold thy son as thou hast said in nought dishonouring his noble race then was laertes joyful and exclaim d what sun hath ris n to-day114 oh blessed gods my son and grandson emulous dispute 600 the prize of glory and my soul exults he ended and minerva drawing nigh to the old king thus counsell d him oh friend whom most i love son of arcesias pray r preferring to the virgin azure-eyed and to her father jove delay not shake thy lance in air and give it instant flight so saying the goddess nerved his arm anew he sought in pray r the daughter dread of jove and brandishing it hurl d his lance it struck 610 eupithes pierced his helmet brazen-cheek d that stay d it not but forth it sprang beyond and with loud clangor of his arms he fell then flew ulysses and his noble son with faulchion and with spear of double edge to the assault and of them all had left none living none had to his home return d but that jove s virgin daughter with a voice of loud authority thus quell d them all peace o ye men of ithaca while yet 620 the field remains undeluged with your blood so she and fear at once paled ev ry cheek  all trembled at the voice divine their arms escaping from the grasp fell to the earth and covetous of longer life each fled back to the city then ulysses sent his voice abroad and with an eagle s force sprang on the people but saturnian jove cast down incontinent his smouldring bolt at pallas  feet and thus the goddess spake 630 laertes  noble son for wiles renown d forbear abstain from slaughter lest thyself incur the anger of high thund ring jove so pallas whom ulysses glad obey d then faithful covenants of peace between both sides ensued ratified in the sight of pallas progeny of jove who seem d in voice and form the mentor known to all   '"
